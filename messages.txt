Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:15am PDT
Oh wow that's really cool
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:14am PDT
Yes that's true. He was an AP teacher at a school in San Jose
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:13am PDT
i have this feeling like i'm no good at spanish anymore D:
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:13am PDT
Yes you conjugated right
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:13am PDT
...sarcasm?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:13am PDT
Of course I no throw pie at you
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:13am PDT
 
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:13am PDT
also:
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:13am PDT
Because usually after one topic dies out then he officially stops us and someone else says the new question or whatever. During the in between he like repeats names of people who talked
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:13am PDT
wait i heard he was an ap teacher once is that true?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:11am PDT
Well we run it ourselves, but when he wants to say something or it's time to change topics he steps in
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:10am PDT
did i conjugate that right?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:10am PDT
yo doy consejos
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:10am PDT
aha why do i have this feeling that i'm gonna get pie-d in the near future jk i know you'd never throw pie at me right?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:09am PDT
that's diff from wilkie - she lets us do stuff by herself
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:09am PDT
i think howard runs things during the socratic seminar for you guys right?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:05am PDT
Haha I will keep your love of pie stored in my brain
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:05am PDT
No your advice is good :)
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:04am PDT
Well they didn't directly say "you're wrong" they were like "no, I think that...."
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:02am PDT
dean winchester from supernatural
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:02am PDT
sorta like mentos :D
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:02am PDT
i seriously love pie though. it's one of my cravings.
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:02am PDT
truer words have never been said
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:02am PDT
life is hard.
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:01am PDT
aha my advice is terrible isn't it? but that's alright
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:01am PDT
what?! that's really mean! wilkie always says to acknowledge the other side with "i understand what you're talking about..."
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:01am PDT
I'm lazy to prepare but then you have to for your grade and ugh life is hard lol
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:01am PDT
Thanks for your advice
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:00am PDT
Haha actually during the Socratic seminar people did kind of say "you're wrong" to the other side
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:59pm PDT
Haha pie :) lol no it's okay. Thanks for offering tho
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:56pm PDT
advice: you should plan out what you want to say a couple days early and bring the points up. just jump in and you'll be fine! my comfort is that english is pretty subjective & as long as you have evidence to support your points... nobody can say you're WRONG
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:55pm PDT
ohh philosophical chairs i hate them so much. i can't really think on the spot
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:55pm PDT
maybe i should get you some to cheer you up about socratic seminars
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:54pm PDT
pie makes everything better
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:54pm PDT
YAS I <3 PIE SO MUCH
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:54pm PDT
aw don't worry! my first socratic seminar in gialdini - i didn't speak at all and i ended up getting 10/20 D: but then the next time i participated twice and i got 15/20... it gets better
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:52pm PDT
(I don't think it will be fine but thanks)
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:52pm PDT
GET WELL SOON!!!
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:52pm PDT
YOU CAN STILL EAT PIE :)
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:52pm PDT
Aww :((((( I HOPE YOU GET BETTER
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:51pm PDT
Or maybe these are just excuses for why I didn't talk
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:51pm PDT
And it was hard to interject because it's philosophical chairs and the people on opposing sides are all like saying similar things uk what I mean
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:51pm PDT
Like when I finally developed what I wanted to say Howard's like "okay changing topics now"
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:50pm PDT
I know in disappointed in myself.
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:49pm PDT
i'm sure your howard grade will be fine though! :)
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:48pm PDT
i am depressed bc i missed PIE
Saturday, March 14, 2015 at 11:48pm PDT

oh. okay
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:33pm PST
PLEASE TELL ME YOU LOVE ENGINEERING
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:32pm PST
._____. that implies that you wanted engineering in the first place. i suspect you are humoring me
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:32pm PST
no, you can take any course in the series as a stand-alone although it looks better and it's easier to pick up the class if you go in order
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:31pm PST
I told him that i didnt want engineering class anymore lol
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:31pm PST
wait so i dont have to follow the order?
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:31pm PST
lol "DIABOLICAL PLAN" i didnt know u had one
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:30pm PST
take digital electronics actually; it's more useful though
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:30pm PST
TO CORRUPT YOU WITH ENGINEERING MADNESSS :)
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:30pm PST
IT'S MY DIABOLICAL PLAN

Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:28pm PST
:( i was shocked and i accidentally said the truth
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:27pm PST

Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:27pm PST
no, she seriously said that. and she told me to list my priorities. she got a little mad when i put apeng as 4th
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:26pm PST
haha "5 maximum"
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:26pm PST
i can't decide :'(
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:25pm PST
uhhh actually wilkie said i should take 5 maximum. this is going to sound presumptuous but (apcalc BC, apeng, apush, ap physics I, apchem) i'm going to die according to all my friends :(
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:24pm PST
haha that would be cool =D haven't had class with you in 5ever
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:24pm PST
but knowing you, you probably want like 4 or something
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:23pm PST
if those are the only 2 AP then i believe u can handle it
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:23pm PST
hm depends on what other classes you're taking
Wednesday, March 4, 2015 at 11:23pm PST
good luck with spanish! you are muy inteligente

Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:18pm PST
i still hate dishonesty though
Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:18pm PST
bc they know that if there's going to be a curve and their grades will be significantly lower, they will get bad grades anyway, so why not control the curve themselves by editing their answers ._.
Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:17pm PST
teach me ur ways
Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:17pm PST
its so beautiful
Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:17pm PST

Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:12pm PST

Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:12pm PST
D= wow what the heck. if she's gonna curve it why even cheat
Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:11pm PST
but they didn't stop! also wilkie didn't notice! :(
Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:11pm PST
nikita even turned around and told them to stop cheating
Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:10pm PST
they'll screw up the curve :(
Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:10pm PST
except a bunch of people were cheating
Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:10pm PST
yes, that makes me feel better
Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:10pm PST

Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:41pm PDT
Rebel me: nah just eat what you want. you can deal with the consequences later
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:40pm PDT
Yes, Jessica. Do you realize that eating candy can be bad for your heart? It can also result in the accumulation of fatty cells that can cause arteries to become partially or fully blocked... (cue lecture)
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:39pm PDT
are you going to lecture to me about how bad that is?
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:38pm PDT
Are you actually going to eat everything :O ?

Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:34pm PDT
by the way, when I first saw you, I thought you were supposed to be a biker or a gang member or something :P
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:33pm PDT
How much candy did you actually get?
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:33pm PDT
This is why I'm going to go find Magnus
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:33pm PDT

Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:31pm PDT
I'll have you know I am more than capable of a suggestive look
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:31pm PDT
aww did you see Alex at least?
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:31pm PDT
Haha you only didn't get candy because you look less like a little girl and more like a random teenager
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:29pm PDT
and sadly no, Jace was nowhere to be found
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:28pm PDT
halloween was okay. didnt get as much candy as last year D=
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:28pm PDT
LOL I did not know you were capable of suggestive looks
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:28pm PDT
Maybe she did it on purpose to get the Twix
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:27pm PDT
So what happened during your halloween, shadowhunter? Did you meet your Jace? (insert suggestive look here)
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:27pm PDT
What? NO. I'm too scared to argue with a complete stranger. Anyway, eventually I had to give that girl Twix. I don't know why she objected to the other candies but not this one
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:25pm PDT

Sunday, October 12, 2014 at 9:35am PDT
Besides, I was just muttering the word 'sarcasm' to myself a little while ago until it stopped sounding like it meant 'sarcasm' anymore. Another example of jamais vu.

50? more like 100 years
Monday, September 15, 2014 at 10:36pm PDT
SORRY FOR IGNORING YOU FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. Yes, that is a sincere apology. :)
Monday, September 15, 2014 at 10:35pm PDT
I still like that face.
Monday, September 15, 2014 at 10:35pm PDT
 
Monday, September 15, 2014 at 10:35pm PDT
^Yes, that is a threat.
Monday, September 15, 2014 at 10:35pm PDT
When I see you again in the locker hall place I am going to be hyper on chocolate. It will make you ripping my arm off look calm.
Monday, September 15, 2014 at 10:34pm PDT
Anyway, I haven't seen you in like 50 years.
Monday, September 15, 2014 at 10:34pm PDT
I have not been on Facebook for such a long time.
Saturday, September 6, 2014 at 11:11pm PDT
SORRY I WAS SO HYPER AND PRACTICALLY RIPPED UR ARM OFF XP
Saturday, September 6, 2014 at 11:11pm PDT
FOR LIKE 30 SECONDS

OMG I SAW U ON FRIDAY
Tuesday, August 26, 2014 at 10:07am PDT
Aha MAYbe
Tuesday, August 26, 2014 at 10:06am PDT
Oh, I heard Insanity Street gets the best views of the sunset this time of year.
Tuesday, August 26, 2014 at 10:06am PDT
No, no. I live on Annoyance Street
Tuesday, August 26, 2014 at 9:38am PDT
^sarcasm boulevard
Tuesday, August 26, 2014 at 9:38am PDT
Maybe I'll see you tomorrow next to your locker! If there aren't too many people.
Tuesday, August 26, 2014 at 9:37am PDT
Anyway, I moved. Now I'm on Insanity Street.
Tuesday, August 26, 2014 at 9:36am PDT
Whatever. I don't need a trophy. Do you live on Sarcasm Street too, out of curiosity?
Sunday, August 24, 2014 at 11:54pm PDT
That address seems most familiar. I think my friend lives on the same street!
Sunday, August 24, 2014 at 11:54pm PDT
I'm sorry, I can not fulfill your requirements. Perhaps you can google a company that has the trophy you seek.
Sunday, August 24, 2014 at 10:47pm PDT
Thank you in advance. Mail to 123 Sarcasm Boulevard on April 1 please.
Sunday, August 24, 2014 at 10:47pm PDT
Its volume must be 190 cm^3 and it must be full of freshly baked donuts.
Sunday, August 24, 2014 at 10:46pm PDT
Really?! It must have high luster, low malleability, high ductility, high conductivity, in a shape resembling a bowl, and weigh exactly 42 grams on Cygnus X-1. Did I mention it has to be shiny?
Sunday, August 24, 2014 at 6:36pm PDT
That can be arranged
Sunday, August 24, 2014 at 5:47pm PDT
I should get a trophy.
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 9:32pm PDT
Aha congratulations
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:53pm PDT
Bye. :)
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:53pm PDT
I can finally use this.

Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:53pm PDT
How can one mangle 'bye' to 'bai?'
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:53pm PDT
^that never made sense to me
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:53pm PDT
BAI.
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:52pm PDT
Sorry g2g bai
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:52pm PDT
Perhaps
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:52pm PDT
It's sarcasm isn't it?
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:52pm PDT
No, really.
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:51pm PDT
Tell me the truth! (Tom Riddle impersonation)
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:50pm PDT
Was it? That's for u to decide
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:50pm PDT
Oh. Okay I'll google it... Later
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:49pm PDT
What? It's like a third world country around Missouri nowadays. Just google it. It's disgusting really. Was that sarcasm? ^^ (your first message)
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:48pm PDT
No
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:48pm PDT
Wow. Sounds like u have a great plan
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:47pm PDT
You've heard about Ferguson right?
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:47pm PDT
I should parenthesize my sarcasm.
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:47pm PDT
Your trust in my skills is admirable. (sarcasm) Then I'll convince everyone that I'm a racist Indian policeman who is not really a policeman.
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:46pm PDT
I'm not even going to doubt that u will b able to possess a gun
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:45pm PDT
Problem- you're not a policemen and you're not white
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:45pm PDT
And it takes less time to do!
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:45pm PDT
Some of my friends' extracurricular activity is a sport. Yours is... Much more. Creative
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:45pm PDT
Thank you for the good luck. All I have to do to get the world to notice me is shoot someone and convince everyone I'm a racist white policeman.
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:44pm PDT
First you'll have to get the world to notice you
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:44pm PDT
Confuse the world? Good luck with that
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:44pm PDT
It is an extracurricular activity.
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:43pm PDT
I haven't stopped. This is just a pause. It is a part of my diabolical plan to confuse the world. No it is not a hobby.
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:43pm PDT
Wow, good job. It seems like u have a hobby in confusing people
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:42pm PDT
Jk*
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:42pm PDT
Aha did u stop putting emoticons u were using them incorrectly? Lol Jo
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:42pm PDT
I have succeeded in my confusion campaign.
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:42pm PDT
Oh. I honestly couldn't tell
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:42pm PDT
I made a resolution to stop putting emoticons randomly so it's difficult to convey my meaning sometimes.
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:41pm PDT
No I don't dislike your personality. That was sarcasm. :)
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:41pm PDT
But hey, farther classes= more exercise? :P
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:40pm PDT
Aha um not really. The last couple of periods are acres campus :(
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:40pm PDT
Lol so u dislike my personality?
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:40pm PDT
Aha um. Thanks for the compliment
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:39pm PDT
Are your classes near each other?
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:38pm PDT
I dislike optimism. And my classes are too far away from each other.
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:38pm PDT
I'm anxious. You are so optimistic.
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:38pm PDT
Not necessarily a death, merely an ending to provide a new beginning
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:37pm PDT
So you're not the least bit excited for school?
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:25pm PDT
I think I'm on depression now. Tomorrow's acceptance. The death of summer...
Saturday, August 23, 2014 at 2:23pm PDT
I'm grieving because summer is ending. There are only 4 days left. :(
Friday, August 22, 2014 at 12:43pm PDT
Stages*
Friday, August 22, 2014 at 12:43pm PDT
-.- why would we be in sages of grief? R u grieving?
Friday, August 22, 2014 at 9:11am PDT
Denial -- We're both stuck in the stages of grief. Was acceptance after this one?
Wednesday, August 20, 2014 at 2:47pm PDT
...sure...
Wednesday, August 20, 2014 at 8:54am PDT
...I did not respond...I did not respond...

actually, you MIGHT have her
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:18pm PDT
I'm happy I don't have her. :) You have to SUFFER.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:18pm PDT
I don't know if my other teachers are super strict or not
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:17pm PDT
Campos]
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:17pm PDT
more of teachers who are super-strict
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:17pm PDT
Yesish.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:17pm PDT
looking out for- as in bad?
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:16pm PDT
You don't sound very sincere. So, any of your teachers that you're looking out for?
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:15pm PDT
or the teacher's reputation
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:15pm PDT
from other people who've had that teacher in the past
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:15pm PDT
oh. Well that's too bad
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:10pm PDT
Question: How can some people know the bad/good teachers before they even get them?
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:09pm PDT
I never said at the same time. I have second period. Unfortunately, I cannot play the Annoy Jessica Game.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:09pm PDT
that's good. aha I bet that's all we have together
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:09pm PDT
if you say so...
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:09pm PDT
wow it seems like you have selective everything
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:07pm PDT
We both have Peffer.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:06pm PDT
No it has not. I stand by the fact that I was in a parallel universe at the time.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:06pm PDT
Selective hearing... I'd almost forgotten. I have selective memory too.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:06pm PDT
it's happened before
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:06pm PDT
or maybe I'll see you walking during brunch and I'll call out ur name but ur selective hearing doesn't hear me
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:05pm PDT
maybe I'll see u at ur locker?
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:05pm PDT
I was correcto.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:05pm PDT
aha may or may not be true
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:05pm PDT
aha im 5'3" ish too
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:04pm PDT
We probably won't even see each other.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:04pm PDT
Just kidding. Wait until the first day.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:04pm PDT
We can check now. I'm 5'3'' ish.

Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:02pm PDT
Actually, you are taller.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:02pm PDT
You are my height, maybe even taller.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:02pm PDT
no, middle row. I felt too short to have one on the top
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:01pm PDT
yeah, they are
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:01pm PDT
aha if you want
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:01pm PDT
Is yours on the top row?
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:01pm PDT
Well, I guess I'll just figure out on the first day. I should just stand in front of Gateway to prevent the inevitable trip. Hey, our lockers are near each other, right?
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:01pm PDT
lol my locker's H4323
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:00pm PDT

Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:00pm PDT
if not, then you have read in ur third period
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 6:00pm PDT
you usually only have a read period if you have PE that period
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:59pm PDT
The Read thing.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:59pm PDT

Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:58pm PDT
Under 4th or 3rd period? Sorry for burdening you with my problems, I'm just a little confused. And I put a lot of thought into things :)
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:57pm PDT

Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:57pm PDT
aha I should have been like you and spent hour thinking
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:54pm PDT
What? so like Read Teacher: Wheaton?
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:54pm PDT
Not your fault. I figured out yesterday after hours of thinking.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:54pm PDT
it says your read teacher on ur scheudle
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:54pm PDT
yeah it was. IT WAS CONFUSING DONT BLAME ME
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:53pm PDT
It was the blue sheet wasn't it.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:53pm PDT
signature*
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:53pm PDT

Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:53pm PDT
You weren't too far away.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:53pm PDT

Yup, I was 6th.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:52pm PDT
so you must have been at the front of the line
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:52pm PDT
Ok, how do you know who your read teacher is?
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:52pm PDT
aha you went so early. I got there at like 8
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:52pm PDT
for read teacher they just stick you into a random teacher has third period prep
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:51pm PDT
It doesn't matter what classes you hve

Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:48pm PDT
Interesting schedule. How can you have read with Wheaton; I thought you were in Chem H?
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:48pm PDT
Regardless, I did not see you today.
Tuesday, August 19, 2014 at 5:48pm PDT
I wasn't counting the minutes, and thank you.
Monday, August 18, 2014 at 1:35am PDT
And no, it did not take me thirty minutes to check, I was just doing some other stuff
Monday, August 18, 2014 at 1:35am PDT
No I can't see it
Monday, August 18, 2014 at 1:05am PDT
And great. See you. (Hopefully we'll go at different times?) xP
Monday, August 18, 2014 at 1:04am PDT
Did you know that in settings or something you can see what your friends see on ur wall. Cool right?
Monday, August 18, 2014 at 1:03am PDT
Um okay sure I'll check for u
Monday, August 18, 2014 at 1:03am PDT
Lolol a bat :P
Sunday, August 17, 2014 at 2:46pm PDT
See you in less that 48 hours! I will bother you mercilessly.
Sunday, August 17, 2014 at 2:46pm PDT
Reason: I don't want to create another Facebook account and friend myself and check that my birthday is invisible. I am still not good at Facebook.
Sunday, August 17, 2014 at 2:45pm PDT
By the way, could you do me a favor? Can you see my birthday?
Sunday, August 17, 2014 at 2:34pm PDT
^I can finally make that face, though it doesn't really apply contextually.
Sunday, August 17, 2014 at 2:34pm PDT
-_-
Sunday, August 17, 2014 at 2:33pm PDT
A bat got into my room in India. A BAT. Seriously? I think that's enough on the other stuff.
Thursday, August 14, 2014 at 1:15pm PDT
Aha okay. Cya
Thursday, August 14, 2014 at 1:15pm PDT
-_- RIGHTT "ORIGINAL IDEA"
Thursday, August 14, 2014 at 1:13pm PDT
Aha I wonder what that "other stuff" is
Thursday, August 14, 2014 at 6:18am PDT
See you on August 19. Maybe. Possibly. Hopefully. -lly?
Thursday, August 14, 2014 at 6:18am PDT
Wait, I've come up with a really original idea...shhhhh... Let's play the "annoy Jessica game!"
Thursday, August 14, 2014 at 6:16am PDT
India downsides: mosquitoes, insects, and other stuff
Wednesday, August 13, 2014 at 10:01am PDT
Yup. August 19
Wednesday, August 13, 2014 at 10:01am PDT
Lets NOT play the "annoy Jessica game" okay?
Wednesday, August 13, 2014 at 10:01am PDT
Um. Idk it feels around the same for me, but maybe a bit shorter?
Wednesday, August 13, 2014 at 10:00am PDT
Aha it seems like u rlly like India
Tuesday, August 12, 2014 at 11:33pm PDT
Hope you are in at least one of my classes so I can annoy you. Wait, we're getting our schedules on the same day, right?
Tuesday, August 12, 2014 at 11:32pm PDT
Now that school is coming up... is it just me or was summer really short this year?
Tuesday, August 12, 2014 at 11:32pm PDT
Yes, I'm still in India but coming back in 3 days. Finally.
Tuesday, August 12, 2014 at 2:24pm PDT
Are you still in India?
Tuesday, August 12, 2014 at 2:24pm PDT
hey its been almost a month. how's ur summer been?
Sunday, July 20, 2014 at 10:57am PDT
No, it wasn't random at all. It was very intriguing. Thank you for telling me
Saturday, July 19, 2014 at 11:17pm PDT
^Was that too random?
Saturday, July 19, 2014 at 11:17pm PDT
And now I know how it feels like to take the Internet for granted.
Saturday, July 19, 2014 at 11:17pm PDT
I have a 10GB internet limit in India.
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 11:49pm PDT
And you're very welcome
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 11:48pm PDT
Okay fine. I agree with you
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 11:03pm PDT
And lastly, thank you. For complimenting my commenting skills.
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 11:03pm PDT
And of course I'm kidding. 2 vocab terms is progress. But not AMAZING progress :)
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 11:02pm PDT
Don't worry. You will soon have an idea of what I am talking about.
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 10:15pm PDT
I have no idea what you're talking about

But, then again, I'm finally on question 2. A Machiavellian leader must be feared more than loved if both are not possible.
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 10:10pm PDT
"has liquid" translates to half full. You are unfailingly optimistic as demonstrated by your thinking 2 vocab terms is "good progress."
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 6:54pm PDT
I see the glass has liquid
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 6:46pm PDT
Do you see a glass as half full or half empty?
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 11:42am PDT
Btw I did two vocab terms for ap euro hw :D good progress, right?
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 11:42am PDT
One of the great mysteries of life
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 11:41am PDT
Why?
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 11:41am PDT
Hahaha I wonder why
Friday, July 11, 2014 at 11:29am PDT
You seem to come up with it very often when it comes to me.

um... alright I "completely" understand =)

Point taken. The dolphins approve of your logic. I think you only TRULY know yourself after you run into a glass door. Explanation not forthcoming.
Monday, June 23, 2014 at 11:28am PDT
Possibly. I mean when do you TRULY know yourself?
Monday, June 23, 2014 at 10:27am PDT
You were once 11. Hence, by a very small leap of logic, I can assume that when you were 11, you didn't not know yourself...

hey guys! do you think people would be interested in attending the climate change march that's taking place this saturday in front of the san jose city hall at 10:30am? i know one parent who is willing to chaperone if people are interested, and if possible, maybe we could let club members know?
Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 12:55pm PDT
Smh
Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 12:43pm PDT
The APES students just showed up smh
Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 12:43pm PDT
Actually nvm
Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 12:42pm PDT
I need help monitoring in the cafeteria ASAP
Monday, April 24, 2017 at 12:40pm PDT

Monday, April 24, 2017 at 12:38pm PDT
I'm coming now
Monday, April 24, 2017 at 12:35pm PDT
Ugh i need help
Monday, April 24, 2017 at 12:33pm PDT
There is no box for the food share table
Monday, April 24, 2017 at 12:30pm PDT
K
Monday, April 24, 2017 at 12:27pm PDT
I'll be happy to take over from there
Monday, April 24, 2017 at 12:27pm PDT
If someone can go to the food share table for the first ten minutes of lunch, that will be great!
Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 11:26am PDT
APES students have also been assigned to rotunda
Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 10:47am PDT
APES students are at the foodshare tables today, so no worries! 😊
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 7:44pm PDT
alright thx
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 7:44pm PDT
*any
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 7:44pm PDT
There is no read this week so there won't be no recycling
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 7:44pm PDT
hey guys what day is recycling this week?
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 6:54pm PDT
I feel like Mrs. Wheaton should know about this, bags and organizing the rotunda
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 6:52pm PDT
It's already hard enough to keep that going these days
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 6:52pm PDT
But right now it's only being directed at food share
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 6:52pm PDT
Definitely, I know APES has a mandatory student recruitment program
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 6:51pm PDT
It'd be useful to make sure every bin has a bag 💼
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 6:50pm PDT
If not then I think the only solution is to get groups that will help clean out the bins, since it's hard to get them to put it in the right ones
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 6:50pm PDT
*help out around school? Maybe we can find a way to get the bins cleaned via those students
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 6:49pm PDT
Is there any sort of detention system that makes the students
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 6:49pm PDT
*them
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 6:49pm PDT
Well a lot of the bins aren't being monitored so people just throw whatever in this
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:52pm PDT
Everyone's thoughts?
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:51pm PDT
Knowing this, how do we jumpstart a solution with the school before break?
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:49pm PDT
So there's a little food in all of them
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:48pm PDT
Yeah but the bins aren't perfectly sorted yet
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:48pm PDT
*though
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:48pm PDT
It's a recycling bin tooth
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:48pm PDT
Oops my phone sent it twice
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:47pm PDT
I think we should let the school know that the bins need to be cleaned better and more frequently.
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:46pm PDT
The link Ashley shared has more info. I think we should let the school know that the bins need to be cleaned better, and more frequently?
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:45pm PDT
This has been a thing that's been happening over the last 2 weeks, it's progressive
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:45pm PDT
Allowing for the flies to germinate
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:45pm PDT
The main problem is that the compost bins aren't being cleaned out thoroughly enough
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:44pm PDT
Ok guys
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:43pm PDT
?
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:43pm PDT
we can try using this method

Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:41pm PDT
What should we change about or system, or tell the school staff. Are the pres and VP still here at school to weigh in on this or are they busy?
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:39pm PDT
Especially with Spring Break coming up
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:39pm PDT
Like Aaron said, we need to talk about the fruit flies in the Rotunda Bins
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:39pm PDT

Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 12:46pm PDT

Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 12:46pm PDT
I had already filled and I filled out the medical info on the front before I had scanned it but if you do have medical concerns, just cross it out
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 12:45pm PDT

Hey, I'm not feeling too well, so Wheaton is sending me home. Maham and Isaiah are at the food share table today. If you guys can give them a hand, that would be great!
Friday, April 7, 2017 at 10:32am PDT

Friday, April 7, 2017 at 10:09am PDT

Friday, April 7, 2017 at 10:09am PDT
Pick up your badges from your 4th period teachers as necessary
Friday, April 7, 2017 at 10:09am PDT
I made necessary adjustments. There will be recycling.
Friday, April 7, 2017 at 10:07am PDT
So nobody will be allowed to leave

Partially also depends on the date of conflicting events

The first event is in less than a fortnight, and paperwork takes ages to process :p

"Not interested" is an acceptable answer. We just need to know for planning purposes.

INTERNS MEETING AT LUNCH IN NEW CAFETERIA TODAY
Monday, March 20, 2017 at 7:08am PDT
Cool
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 11:57pm PDT
i could also make a 3d model of the gazebo that future students could refer to for future repairs
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 11:49pm PDT
I'd be down to help with that
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 11:48pm PDT
In that case, we should probably get measurements for the gazebo and the parts we need to replace beforehand
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 11:43pm PDT
We can get funding. We just need to know what to buy.
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:22pm PDT
It might be a multi-day project, so maybe over spring break?
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:22pm PDT
I can ask my dad to look at it but we would need funding to replace the post
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:22pm PDT
i...have no idea, to be honest.
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:21pm PDT
Or would it be held up enough by the other posts
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:20pm PDT
Wouldn't you need to remove the roof to replace the post?
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:20pm PDT
Mhmm
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:20pm PDT
yep!
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:20pm PDT
The gazebo is the hexagonal structure near the science portables, right?
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:18pm PDT
^ill have to figure it out later. currently planning to start planting!
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:18pm PDT

3 entire panels on the sides have been knocked out and theres one post that's split open
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:14pm PDT

Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:14pm PDT
im not sure...i dont know how to fix damages that large, either. 😭
Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:14pm PDT

Sunday, March 19, 2017 at 4:13pm PDT

The origin of churros is unclear. One theory suggests they were brought to Europe from China by the Portuguese. The Portuguese sailed for the Orient and, as they returned from Ming Dynasty China to Portugal, they brought along with them new culinary techniques, including altering dough for youtiao, also known as Youzagwei in southern China, for Portugal. The new pastry soon crossed the border into Spain, where it was modified to have the dough extruded through a star-shaped die rather than pulled.[1]

yikes. it seems to be on ours too, though. hopefully the church can unlock it, its probably a mistake
Friday, December 16, 2016 at 2:42pm PST
Yup, but we only have it on the first two cases closest to the parking lot because those are the only ones that are ours.

do your locks look like this:
Friday, December 16, 2016 at 2:41pm PST
hmm. it could be
Friday, December 16, 2016 at 2:41pm PST
I'm part of that church and I'm also part of the crew that uses the locks on the cases. They're pretty responsible about where they put it and don't usually mess up.
Friday, December 16, 2016 at 2:40pm PST
The lock isn't the churches I don't think!
Friday, December 16, 2016 at 2:37pm PST
good news and bad news everyone!! good news: i found todd and he said that the lock might be from the church who uses our gym on sundays. the other sheds next to the recycling shed have the same silver lock that was placed on the gardening shed. bad news: since he has a good idea of whos lock it is, hes going to wait until sunday to ask the church since thats the day they meet. that means besides starting seedlings, no gardening outside today.
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 10:21am PST

Everyone who hasn't yet: I understand that tonight is crazy busy, so if you can't work on the list until tomorrow, I understand. Please do have it filled out by tomorrow night at 9:00, though. :)
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 9:31pm PST
Thank you to everyone who has been filling that out
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 9:30pm PST
Hey guys! So we've got ~50 names on the recycling list so far
Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 6:04pm PST
In that case, I recommend searching for them in google drive and then going to schoolloop
Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 5:58pm PST
i cant find many of the people in my wing on either the master list or the sign up sheets
Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 5:53pm PST
Actually, that's a good point. If someone has filled out information for someone you have listed on your folder, copy-paste their information and specify the number of times they have shown up in your folder - this way, we know which people are moving from team to team, etc.
Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 5:51pm PST
In your folder only, that's correct.
Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 5:51pm PST
For the amount of times theyve signed in, is it only for collect?
Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 5:50pm PST
linked on the officers page
Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 5:50pm PST
yep
Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 5:44pm PST
we're adding to the doc titled November Comprehensive Recycling List right

Thanks guys! 😊
Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 11:04am PST
If you can't find information by control-f for a student in any of the spreadsheets, use the search bar in google drive to see if their info shows up on any of the other spreadsheets. If you still can't find information for someone, then try schoolloop.
Saturday, November 19, 2016 at 11:02am PST
Check the officers page

So to clarify again, the pizza mentioned would be for compost monitors, since we can't give them hours.
Tuesday, November 15, 2016 at 10:16pm PST
So to clarify - what Navarrete & I talked about was having pizza parties after school every couple weeks to reward people. We can't actually give service hours during school (god, I wish we could - we're flying under the radar with recycling as it is).

Just a thought, but what if we put signs on the tables at the library talking about recycling and composting, or at least where the bins are? I see quite a few at UC Berk's libraries.
Friday, October 21, 2016 at 10:17am PDT
But Wheaton doesn't have that list
Friday, October 21, 2016 at 10:17am PDT
But we asked everyone for third period teachers?
Friday, October 21, 2016 at 10:16am PDT
She doesn't have a list of students third period teachers, so she can't send an email
Friday, October 21, 2016 at 10:16am PDT
Cause we never sent a 3rd period teacher list
Friday, October 21, 2016 at 10:15am PDT

Unless Wheaton tells me otherwise, we'll have recycling, but as soon as people get there they'll be signing in with their officers and getting started. Ideally, Sort should set up during brunch. (That's how I used to do it in sophomore year...)

*(Kayla, Pallas, if you guys have time), can you take care of that?
Monday, October 10, 2016 at 10:39pm PDT
I know this week is going to be crazy for everyone, but we'll survive by sheer willpower and awesomeness. Business item: we need a complete list of members that we can schoolloop. Lily B, Aakash, (Kayla,

"unless its necessary"
Sunday, October 9, 2016 at 4:05pm PDT
True but remember we used yamaguchi's room once?
Sunday, October 9, 2016 at 2:22pm PDT
we shouldnt have to change locations unless its necessary
Sunday, October 9, 2016 at 2:21pm PDT
507
Sunday, October 9, 2016 at 1:58pm PDT
Would we still have the meeting in 507 or his room
Sunday, October 9, 2016 at 1:41pm PDT
Ask him tomorrow?
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 10:37pm PDT
I think creger said he could do it this week
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 10:37pm PDT
did he say he could sub in?
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 10:36pm PDT
should we just ask creger if he can do it this week?
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 10:36pm PDT
yes that would be awesome
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 4:34pm PDT
󾀼
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 4:33pm PDT
Sounds reasonable, but ideally we still want to find a permanent monitor. Do we want to ask Navarrete to reach out to staff to see of anyone is interested?
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 4:03pm PDT
Kathryn, what do you think?
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 3:50pm PDT
in case that one of them isnt avaliable
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 3:50pm PDT

Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 2:32pm PDT
Should we just ask them to rotate
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 2:31pm PDT
So we have like 3 backups now
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 2:31pm PDT
Oh and bambusa said he's willing to be a backup
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 1:23pm PDT
sorry i forgot ;P
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 1:23pm PDT
nvm you did
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 1:23pm PDT
oh wait
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 1:23pm PDT

Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 1:23pm PDT
okie
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 1:21pm PDT
yep there were new people! not sure if theyre from art club, though
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 1:20pm PDT
I know there were some new ppl in gardening
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 1:20pm PDT
We only had 2 new ppl so maybe they were art club?
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 1:18pm PDT
oh okiee
Saturday, October 8, 2016 at 1:17pm PDT
I don't think Art Club showed up? Or if they did, they just joined Reuse&Gardening. LeAnn, May, what were your takes on yesterday?
Friday, October 7, 2016 at 3:20pm PDT
Did anyone talk to art club
Friday, October 7, 2016 at 3:15pm PDT
He's still coming to Reuse; we just probably won't be making signs
Friday, October 7, 2016 at 3:08pm PDT
We just talked to him
Friday, October 7, 2016 at 3:08pm PDT
 
Friday, October 7, 2016 at 3:08pm PDT
Nothing has changed
Friday, October 7, 2016 at 3:08pm PDT
We are still meeting up
Friday, October 7, 2016 at 3:07pm PDT
If anyone could go by where we were supposed to have the meeting and stand there for about 10 min or so, we'll be able to tell people that the meeting is cancelled
Friday, October 7, 2016 at 3:07pm PDT
So we have to hold off
Friday, October 7, 2016 at 3:07pm PDT
He texted back and said we don't have permission from the district to have a good share table at school yet
Friday, October 7, 2016 at 3:06pm PDT
I was asking him about possible service hours for art club/people that make posters
Friday, October 7, 2016 at 3:05pm PDT
did he cancel last minute?
Friday, October 7, 2016 at 3:04pm PDT
HNNGH NEXT WEEK!!!
Friday, October 7, 2016 at 3:04pm PDT

Friday, October 7, 2016 at 2:11pm PDT

Yes - check this chat to find out if it will be informal (i.e. we meet at the flagpole and talk for five-ten minutes) or a legit sit-down meeting. We need a sit-down meeting soon, but until I know if there's a classroom available I won't make this sit-down.
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 11:06pm PDT
Wait meeting tomorrow?
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 10:21pm PDT
that goes for the other sub sections for science and eco

Finally: who would be up for an officer meet-up/meeting tomorrow at lunch? Send a clover if you're willing. :)
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 8:23pm PDT
Also, only officers should have sign-in folders. Apparently a non-officer somehow acquired one today / took on the role of a wing captain and wouldn't let her recyclers go...? If you see something like that, please come let me, Andrew, or Wheaton know.
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 8:20pm PDT
For Sort, recyclers should take ONE glove. ONLY ONE. This minimizes waste. :)

Mrs smith suggested the culinary arts teacher
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 3:01pm PDT
so we should be fine this year this week
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 3:00pm PDT
Hmm
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 3:00pm PDT
pretty sure, we only have one supervisor last year, right?
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 3:00pm PDT
do you think he'll be able to supervise gardening too? :/ i contacted ms. Munoz for future collaborations
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 2:47pm PDT
You wanted to message me but idk about meeting
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 2:47pm PDT
Heimsoth-nauss needs recycling bins
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 2:45pm PDT
Navarrete will be watching Reuse tomorrow, since we'll also be making signs for the food share table
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 2:40pm PDT
not me... btw can someone fill me in on todays meeting? i was running around looking for supervisors, to no avail :(
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 2:36pm PDT
Is anyone supposed to meet me after school? I vaguely remember arranging a meeting, but I forget with whom.

Are you sending the list the way it is
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 10:21pm PDT
I'd say don't delete them, but don't send their names in. If they care, they'll complain and we can fix it then
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 10:07pm PDT
do I delete them off the list they literally gave no info
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 10:06pm PDT
Then you can't really add them

Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:58pm PDT
Btw, can anyone tell me what the data thing is or will Wheaton explain it to me

ooooooh
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:50pm PDT

Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:40pm PDT
but I'm not sure how to find the officers' 4th period
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:40pm PDT
I'm comparing it to the handwritten sheets we got on Club Rush week
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:39pm PDT
so I've got the master sheet set up
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:39pm PDT

Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:37pm PDT
Also other people who may not be on all sign-in lists
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:36pm PDT
(looking at you, Dhruv ;) )
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:36pm PDT
also, make sure all the officers are on the list
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:36pm PDT
I recommend comparing the new list with last week's list and checking who's been added
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:35pm PDT
is there any other way to do that
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:35pm PDT
wait so am I just supposed to check the 4th period list for accuracy bc that'll take a long time LOL

k so in a nutshell my friend is asking me if he can sign up for the teams because he signed up for recycling during rush week but had no idea about today since he didnt see the post regarding recycling. also i went through the list of people who signed up for this club and i didnt see his name, but i remember him signing up since i asked him. is it okay if i just tell him to sign up for the science portables since that's an empty space, im assuming?

Agreed. I'll bring the laptop
Thursday, September 29, 2016 at 1:52am PDT
it'll reduce chaos
Thursday, September 29, 2016 at 1:51am PDT
everyone should be on a signup sheet except like the people who didnt sign up. we can add their name in later. also since everything was rearranged, we should keep like a laptop out so that if someone isnt at where they wanted to be, they can come to us, we look up their name, and tell them where they should be
Thursday, September 29, 2016 at 1:11am PDT
yeah def. np

Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 9:12pm PDT
It's in the shared Google folder
Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 9:12pm PDT
it's not opening up
Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 9:11pm PDT
And this way you have my info to
Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 9:11pm PDT
can you send me that on email
Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 9:11pm PDT
This way I don't have to search through your officer applications every time I want to contact / share something with you

Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 4:05pm PDT
󾀼
Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 4:04pm PDT
And somebody asked
Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 4:04pm PDT
No was just confused between forms
Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 4:04pm PDT
Does it not? They should be able to sign up until 5:30, so maybe holding off until then would make your lives easier. ;)
Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 4:03pm PDT
Okay
Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 4:03pm PDT
It should.
Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 4:03pm PDT
Does the original team signup form still work for people signing up?
Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 4:02pm PDT
󾀼
Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 3:59pm PDT
Also, shift all specified deadlines down two hours. Wheaton won't be sending out the teacher list until tomorrow morning, so we don't need to rush
Wednesday, September 28, 2016 at 3:53pm PDT
Okay, I've shared the folder with all officers whose emails were on the Rush Week signup spreadsheet

Officers will be given supervising roles so we don't have to
Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 5:27pm PDT
but captains

I think general members are supposed to sign up
Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 5:27pm PDT
yeah
Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 5:26pm PDT
Isn't that the general group?
Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 5:26pm PDT
like that form that was posted in science &eco 2016-2017
Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 5:25pm PDT
wait im confused now, do we still have to sign up for teams/wings?
Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 4:44pm PDT
It just shows up as a message request and they will have the option of whether or not to accept the message
Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 4:43pm PDT
You can message people even if they aren't friends on fb
Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 4:36pm PDT
The second form
Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 4:17pm PDT
do either of them ask for 3rd period teacher?

Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 2:54pm PDT
And I don't have their emails
Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 2:53pm PDT
They're not on the sign-in sheet as far as I can tell
Sunday, September 25, 2016 at 2:53pm PDT
Btw I can't add the people who asked to be added to the FB page because I don't have their emails

Okie thank you

Y'all are officers too. You've just got more general duties. Basically we're trying to figure out where your interests lie and what your talents are.
Saturday, September 24, 2016 at 9:03pm PDT
What about the interns?
Saturday, September 24, 2016 at 9:02pm PDT
Whoopppsie daisy
Saturday, September 24, 2016 at 9:01pm PDT
So what I meant was officers will be serving as organizers, which means they shouldn't sign up for wings/teams, since they'll be LEADING the wings/teams
Saturday, September 24, 2016 at 9:01pm PDT
Sure np
Saturday, September 24, 2016 at 6:48pm PDT

She asked that we email her a summary of how Reuse functions. Also, I'll be creating a form for people to sign up for recycling. As Andrew pointed out (thanks, Andrew!), just sending out a spreadsheet will lead to people screwing with each other's data, so we'll instead send them a form and a link to the spreadsheet created by the form so they can see which spots are still open.

Hey guys, I've shifted partners again to accommodate specific requests. Please check again to make sure you know whom you're with. I'd recommend messaging/contacting your partner to make sure you have everything hammered out.
Monday, September 19, 2016 at 6:37pm PDT

Hey guys! So Lily's going to be working on her Johnson project today so she asked us if we could finalize the report...basically there's some stuff on the slides that isn't in the report and we just need to add it. I'll work on it later tonight but if you guys can get started that'd be great!!!
Monday, June 5, 2017 at 11:28am PDT
Sure 🙂
Monday, June 5, 2017 at 11:28am PDT

Basically to practice
Monday, June 5, 2017 at 11:26am PDT
Hey guys! Can we meet up at lunch to discuss our presentation? It won't be long. I just want to clarify some things I added this morning because I didn't put a ton of text on the slides to guide you.

Monday, June 5, 2017 at 10:19am PDT
I can do problem situation and current biker capacity
Monday, June 5, 2017 at 10:18am PDT
lily is cost analysis and justification
Monday, June 5, 2017 at 10:18am PDT

Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 6:03pm PDT
lol neither did i, but i basically bs'ed it using inspect element to change the values on my practice portfolio :D i don't think he'll notice and all you have to do is make up answers to the other questions
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 6:03pm PDT
 
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 2:51pm PDT

Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:42am PDT
I'll do it!
Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:41am PDT

Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:41am PDT
check school loop. you have to add in a screenshot of the google maps route (use the quarry lakes trail; i mentioned that in my part)
Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:28am PDT
How do I do the solution?
Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 9:28am PDT
Wait oh crap I forgot
Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 8:20am PDT

Sunday, May 14, 2017 at 6:28pm PDT
im fine with that :)
Sunday, May 14, 2017 at 6:28pm PDT
any other ideas? Sorry if this is too specific. We should make sure there's an article for everyone!
Sunday, May 14, 2017 at 6:27pm PDT
I nominate pollutant effects on human disease! If we end up picking this one, I'll do Assessing the Impact of the Environment on Cancer by Forbes.
Sunday, May 14, 2017 at 5:00pm PDT
Sandra its your turn to present right?? and we can just chose a topic to do it on I guess
Sunday, May 14, 2017 at 4:59pm PDT
ok I asked a couple people and I think we do
Sunday, May 14, 2017 at 4:48pm PDT

Sunday, May 7, 2017 at 2:14pm PDT
hey guys! i'm not going to be in apes tmrw (ap physics :/ :'( ) so i would be v appreciative if you added to the bike project document bc apparently wheaton will be checking it. ty in advance!
Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 1:48pm PDT
tysm allan :) omg sandra that was my reaction too
Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 12:29pm PDT
Study it for the test on Tuesday after break
Thursday, April 13, 2017 at 12:20pm PDT
what is this

Wednesday, April 12, 2017 at 10:10am PDT
This is the test bank
Wednesday, April 12, 2017 at 10:10am PDT
 
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:38pm PDT
I'll take 19 and 20 !
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:31pm PDT
Ya sounds good! I can do 18
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:29pm PDT
so we'll have to read our 'assigned' chapters with more focus than the other ones
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:28pm PDT
if you guys agree to this, i'll take ch 16-17
Tuesday, April 11, 2017 at 5:28pm PDT
hey guys! so because we have a group test tmrw, in addition to our individual notes, we can each focus on 1-2 chapters so we have an expert for each chapter in our group!
Friday, April 7, 2017 at 6:15am PDT
No we don't
Friday, April 7, 2017 at 4:54am PDT
i just remembered... we don't have a ch 19-20 test today, right?
Monday, April 3, 2017 at 6:16pm PDT
its only one per group
Monday, April 3, 2017 at 6:16pm PDT
yeah I asked someone
Monday, April 3, 2017 at 5:59pm PDT
I'll ask someone
Monday, April 3, 2017 at 5:59pm PDT
I think so but I'm not completely sure
Monday, April 3, 2017 at 5:51pm PDT
lol i once had this teacher who would have given each of us 5/20 if we did it in a group when it wasn't supposed to be. i don't think wheaton is like that but still
Monday, April 3, 2017 at 5:50pm PDT
hey guys! so the sleuthing assignment is group, right? just making sure b/c she didn't specify on school loop :)
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 11:17pm PDT
I just submitted the link to the google form btw
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 11:09pm PDT
I made some changes but there are still some sections that don't correlate to what we did
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 11:09pm PDT
Ok cool! Also when you're done with the report do you mind looking over the proposal to make sure everything matches up
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 11:03pm PDT
the final report. that's the part i'm working on
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 10:00pm PDT
And do you mean the last section of the final report or the proposal
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 9:59pm PDT
Ok I'll add the data
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 9:58pm PDT
the last section is about implications & extending the project for future endeavors - conclusion
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 9:58pm PDT
i think including the pie chart & percentages would be great
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 9:58pm PDT
yes, results does mean actual results
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 9:57pm PDT
i'll print the final doc b/c i haven't done my part yet
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 9:47pm PDT
GUYS for the results section of the proposal are we supposed to put our actual results??? Or just like how we collected/evaluated our data?
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 8:58pm PDT
Also can everyone look over the proposal doc and make sure everything matches up with both the final report and the rubric
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 7:53pm PDT
Does anyone have a colored printer
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 6:22pm PDT
But yeah put that in when you can :-)
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 6:22pm PDT
Oh cool! Anisha actually put in Hugo's emails from you so those will work too!
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 6:21pm PDT
YAY so happy :))
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 6:21pm PDT
we're not going to lose points
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 6:21pm PDT
i asked hugo to send us the email from the principal & he did
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 6:21pm PDT
also omg you know that part in the rubric for results where it says to get full credit "in addition to 'proficient' descriptors project receives letter/email of commendation from relevant agency/community/individuals affected by project"
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 6:20pm PDT
ty allan haha btw that doesn't even sound like english
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 6:07pm PDT
In case she puts it on the test tomorrow : )
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 6:07pm PDT
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowisetrepla
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 7:04pm PDT
I'll do it rn
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 7:04pm PDT
omg thanks for reminding me
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 7:04pm PDT
btw did we submit the presentation?
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:51pm PDT
sounds good to me! and no worries :-)
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:50pm PDT
sorry i took so long to finish
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:50pm PDT
sandra, what do you think?
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:43pm PDT
thanks anyway, i'm going to go with adding some projected data considering an increase in sorting accuracy to 75%
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:43pm PDT
omg i just realized that "wheaton" autocorrected to "wheat" lol
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:43pm PDT
I was gnna say the data is the same as ahs data but you already put that haha
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:42pm PDT
I'm not so sure either
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:38pm PDT
honestly i'm confused as to whether wheat's referencing the process itself or the data collected
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:37pm PDT
any ideas about what else to put in "lessons learned"?
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:35pm PDT
ok cool!
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:34pm PDT
sure! i just got rid of the environmental benefits slide & lessons learned shouldn't take that long anyway -- i think i can get my part done in 2 minutes
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:33pm PDT
Also keep in mind we have a 10 minute max so you don't have to do that much!!!
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:33pm PDT
spreading awareness part*
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:32pm PDT
I'll do the presentation part
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 6:32pm PDT
Wait lily do you wanna do the conclusion part since you wrote it and you'll know it better
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 4:13pm PDT
That's all we need for the presentation
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 4:13pm PDT
 
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 4:13pm PDT
Yeah I'm pretty sure it's only for the paper
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:52pm PDT
I think we only do that for our paper
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:30pm PDT
idk what that even means in the context of our project
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:29pm PDT
wait also... for the conclusion, we also have to "quantify environmental benefit"??
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:20pm PDT
:)
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:20pm PDT
lol hope wheaton doesn't think that's too low or something
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:20pm PDT
hmm i'll just go w/ 10 bins & hope for the best
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:20pm PDT
im not sure sorry :(
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:20pm PDT
& idk how many to approximate
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:20pm PDT
haha sorry i'm trying to do the extrapolation part of the conclusion

Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 6:13pm PDT
hey guys! so hugo says he's going to be @ thornton w/ the equipment @ 10:20 AM, & we'll probably be there too by 11:00. i've emailed the attendance clerk as well (ik late) but i don't think there's anything else we have to do...
Wednesday, March 1, 2017 at 6:42pm PST
"Pacific biodiesel begins farming on Hawaii's biofuel crop project"
Wednesday, March 1, 2017 at 10:53am PST

Monday, February 27, 2017 at 5:58pm PST
i'll also be contacting wheaton (& johnson) about setting up that field trip on march 8 :) lmk if there seem to be any problems!
Monday, February 27, 2017 at 5:56pm PST
for sandra & me, this means we need to create & practice the presentation for leadership: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12_ubwTDQZOLpn8dHN4coIMwlL-rZvWrhLWRgE6RY2e0/edit?usp=sharing
Monday, February 27, 2017 at 5:54pm PST
so for allan & anisha, this means you guys need to make posters, make the google form for collecting waste audit data, and the initial survey for sustainability knowledge
Monday, February 27, 2017 at 5:51pm PST
on another note, hugo said that we should start working on outreach material for thornton assuming that the waste result audit results will be similar to thornton
Monday, February 27, 2017 at 5:50pm PST
here's the link for the group doc: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h5Wr5zB7ENKkx0rqTOZ0mp5SkOfxKobHwOYNkDgIpmo/edit?usp=sharing
Monday, February 27, 2017 at 5:50pm PST
hey guys! so from what i could glean from wheaton's spiel today, by thursday, each of us will have to have a current event article/summary done + a group advantages/disadvantages chart for our topic: crop-based biofuels
Saturday, February 11, 2017 at 10:36am PST

Friday, February 10, 2017 at 5:40pm PST
sorry for bothering you all again but if any of you found activity 5, would you mind sending me a link? bc if it's not on school loop, i think we need to let wheaton know

Hi guys! (in case you don't already know, Bhavi, Kelly asked me to be in the ads group) I was thinking about asking Ryan from 5th period Johnson? Also, if you guys have any ideas for potential ads, you can add them to this google doc bc I won't see you tmrw :(

I'll do it in like 10 mins

Ok is it already alphabetical?
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:40pm PDT
Everyone whose first names don't start with A :p
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:40pm PDT
So I only need to loopmail everyone after the first 40?
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:39pm PDT
Reword it if you want, but that's what we need people to know

Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:31pm PDT
Remember that this is our master list of sign-ups:
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:31pm PDT
You'll therefore probably need to write ~5 different emails
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:31pm PDT
Loopmail only lets students contact 50 people per email.
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:24pm PDT
but what do you mean the other 250? cuz if you typed in the first 40 off ur loopmail, doesnt that mean i still have to type those in whenever i email from my schoolloop?
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:23pm PDT
yeah
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:15pm PDT
And it should be a one-time thing; every following email could be just a reply to the previous email. Therefore, Aakash, would you please take care of the other 250?
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:14pm PDT
That's actually shorter than the amount of time it takes to fill out service hours every week.
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:14pm PDT
At this rate, emailing them all should take about 30 minutes.
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:13pm PDT
It took me less than 4 minutes to type up the 46 names.
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:13pm PDT
But it's up to you
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:13pm PDT
That's why I was saying a better idea would be to fix the names on the email addresses
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:13pm PDT
Okay, I took care of the As
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:12pm PDT
I'm going with that before Schoolloop deletes my email again :P
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 4:04pm PDT

Andrew, what is the most updated list of wings and teams?
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:48pm PDT
This could be a challenge indeed.
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:47pm PDT
for no reason that I can see
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:47pm PDT
..........it just closed the loopmail without saving
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:46pm PDT
For one, my official name is Andrejus, so if I'm not there that's why
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:45pm PDT
I've got all the As done.
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:45pm PDT
Like, genuinely the majority. I'm correcting them as I go.
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:35pm PDT
Also, the majority of the names in our master spreadsheet are misspelled.
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:32pm PDT
This does in fact take a very long time.
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:31pm PDT
...I'm starting to see the problem
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:17pm PDT
Okay so I'm going to try the loopmail
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:11pm PDT
Okay
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:11pm PDT
Not a sufficiently in-depth one, at least. I definitely want such a meeting next week.
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:09pm PDT
As a club officer meeting
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:09pm PDT
If not she wants us to meet next week
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:08pm PDT
Was there a discussion about expectations for officers and wing monitors?
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:07pm PDT
Gotcha I'll text her
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:04pm PDT

Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:04pm PDT
Kathryn Mrs. Wheaton wants to know what you discussed on Friday at lunch
Wednesday, October 12, 2016 at 3:03pm PDT
I'm going to see how long it takes to loopmail everyone. Who currently has access to a computer?

Good Morning Mr.Navarrete, My son Mihir Chandran (Grade-9, SDC) signed up for Science & ECO club last month. He put in his email address (mihir.chandran2002@gmail.com) on the sign-up sheet. To date, he has not received any email or information about the club meetings and/or activities. Also, there is no update on the School bulletin. I really appreciate getting some details relating to this club like -- When is (was) the 1st meeting, how often do the members meet, where is the meeting held and how is the information communicated to the members (email??). Is there a link on AHS website where these details can be found? Thanks & Regards, Tarun Chandran (Mihir's Dad)
Tuesday, October 11, 2016 at 7:44pm PDT
I received this email via Navarrete from a disgruntled parent:
Tuesday, October 11, 2016 at 7:44pm PDT
I know! Ha, funny story -
Tuesday, October 11, 2016 at 7:44pm PDT
Considering how many emails go out
Tuesday, October 11, 2016 at 7:44pm PDT
Because there's no way that a large percentage of members aren't getting the info
Tuesday, October 11, 2016 at 7:43pm PDT
Yeah I think maybe just some of the email addresses r inaccurate
Tuesday, October 11, 2016 at 7:43pm PDT
what up...???
Tuesday, October 11, 2016 at 7:42pm PDT
We could try the email list again, with Kim (? would that work, Kim?) posting equivalent messages on FB.
Tuesday, October 11, 2016 at 7:39pm PDT
I just worry that people wouldn't check it often enough.
Tuesday, October 11, 2016 at 7:38pm PDT

Tuesday, October 11, 2016 at 6:12pm PDT
Or the same account
Tuesday, October 11, 2016 at 6:12pm PDT
Yeah but if it's loopmail then all the names have to be added from the same email

Hello friends :) when is the physics project due?
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 3:37pm PDT
lol he updated
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:46pm PDT
what?
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:33pm PDT
does the 10V cancel out somewhere? otherwise it wouldn't be ambiguous enough like would be specific to your situation
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:30pm PDT
does the outside circle also have some charge because it's connected to the negative part of the battery?
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:29pm PDT
like where is Q
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:29pm PDT
where is the charge
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:29pm PDT
that only works if there's charge inside
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:28pm PDT
this is so confuse
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:28pm PDT
LOL
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:28pm PDT
what
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:26pm PDT
you plug that*
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:26pm PDT
And you equation back into the original function
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:26pm PDT
You get another equation for Q
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:26pm PDT
You know that v(r) = 10 and if you plug in the inner radius into the variable r
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:24pm PDT
idk how to use gauss's law without knowing Q
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:24pm PDT
but that's different from charge
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:24pm PDT
oh
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:24pm PDT
it's no potential on the outside
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 8:23pm PDT
no charge on outside, its the "ground"
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 7:48pm PDT
outside circle*
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 7:48pm PDT
or no charge on the outside dot
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 7:48pm PDT
so like is there positive charge on the inside dot and negative charge on the outside dot
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 7:48pm PDT
hey guys for the lab do any of u know where the charge is

Like for the e underscore 0 thingie? That's just the constant name
Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 6:25pm PST
Like basically where does the pi come from I get where everything else went
Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 6:25pm PST
How do you get the 0
Tuesday, February 21, 2017 at 6:25pm PST

Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 10:38pm PST

Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 10:30pm PST
but then again I didn't know a bunch of quiz MC either
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 10:30pm PST
is there anything about density?
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 10:29pm PST
Nothing remotely like those show up on the quiz
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 10:07pm PST
also, sorry to keep asking, but anyone willing to explain any of those problems from the second wileyplus? doesnt even have to be all, even 1-2 would help
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 10:07pm PST
so just in case
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 10:07pm PST
but i can just do the work and input the answers tmrw before 10:00 after asking him

Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 10:06pm PST
ohhhhhh
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 10:06pm PST

ah wel
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 10:06pm PST
no itll give u more

Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 10:06pm PST
it saif 35% deduction? so im guessing 65% max score?
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 10:06pm PST
yeah but better than nothing
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 10:05pm PST
but it reduces your score right

Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 9:43pm PST
wait brittany are you sure the last one for #18 is correct?
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 9:42pm PST
Yes

No dont add it
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 9:40pm PST
or just leave it?
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 9:40pm PST
and the acceleration we add to gravity?
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 9:40pm PST
ah ty

guys what's number 36 for ch 11
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 9:38pm PST
my answer for number 18 is 0.19216, 0.19216, 1911.960784

anyone know how to do #2 on the second wileyplus assignemnt? i cant figure it out at all
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 9:28pm PST
Torque = Wnc / theta
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 8:14pm PST
what did you guys get
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 8:14pm PST
For number 2 in the lab
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 7:40pm PST
i just remembered hahahah
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 7:40pm PST
thank you!!
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 7:40pm PST
remember to put lab members names on lab report
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 6:11pm PST
but hard lol
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 6:11pm PST
it's straightforward
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 6:11pm PST
The Wiley is wayyyyyyy harder
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 6:11pm PST
No
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 6:02pm PST
is there any derivation
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:59pm PST
omg bless
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:58pm PST
Dont bother memorizing them
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:58pm PST
No they provide it
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:43pm PST
HAHAHAHA
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:43pm PST
and pray we dont have to derive them
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:43pm PST
or do you have to just memorize them
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:43pm PST
do they provide the moment of inertias

That's true - just remember that ring and disk race thingie he did - its much easier to remember
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:37pm PST
I guess
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:37pm PST
tru. so things which have less mass in the center are more stable
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:36pm PST
Because that's why ring is mr^2 but disk is 0.5mr^2
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:36pm PST
Smaller right
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:36pm PST
if theres more mass concentrated in the center, is I bigger or smaller?
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:34pm PST
Ch 11 Wiley makes me :(
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:29pm PST

Its pretty equal but angular momentum is the one thing that came up a lot
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 5:03pm PST
is it more on ch 10 or more on ch11
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:53pm PST
oooh nice thank you!!!
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:53pm PST
Nope
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:51pm PST
did anything require integration to find the moment of inertia formula for an object?
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:50pm PST
lol he's so extra
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:43pm PST
The frq was more straight forward than the mc
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:43pm PST
Theres 1 frq and 11 mc i think?
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:42pm PST
Work fast!
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:42pm PST
I failed 😞
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:33pm PST
also how was the test? :)
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:27pm PST
Radius
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:26pm PST
is that from middle to end, or middle to where the mass was located?
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:26pm PST
I have 18.12 cm
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:13pm PST
If it was in class
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 4:13pm PST
Did anyone verify the length of the rod
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 12:07am PST
k
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 12:07am PST
I'll try to double check tmrw if he still had the setups
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 12:07am PST
Either way, 0.03m won't make a huge difference in calculations
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 12:06am PST
are you sure, I measured 19cm for half the length but idk
Tuesday, December 20, 2016 at 11:30pm PST
thank you!
Tuesday, December 20, 2016 at 11:30pm PST
thats half the rod

it seems so easy to understand, but then i actually try to solve a problem and im like nope!
Tuesday, December 20, 2016 at 9:27pm PST
did he say anything about what's on it?
Tuesday, December 20, 2016 at 9:27pm PST
me! :)
Tuesday, December 20, 2016 at 9:27pm PST
guess who's gonna fail that rotation quiz?

the data u gave us is wrong lily
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 7:26am PDT
if u add a meter to the horizontal distance we are close to the actual v0
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 7:26am PDT
lmaooo
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 5:45am PDT
based on our data
Thursday, October 6, 2016 at 5:45am PDT

much appreciated
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:48pm PDT
gotcha
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:47pm PDT
Yes, yes we do

lol*
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:47pm PDT
olo*
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:47pm PDT
im so confused olo
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:47pm PDT
so we make a graph of our experimental angles and heights and make a scatter plot?
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:46pm PDT
yeah
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:39pm PDT
Experimental is the data we recorded.
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:33pm PDT
not the data we recorded?
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:33pm PDT
so that should be from the equation we get
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:29pm PDT
Don't think so. Use the graph to find the max height
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:28pm PDT
So we need to find the best fit line?
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:27pm PDT
Experimental
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:26pm PDT
Do we make the graph of our experimental value or calculated value?
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 9:26pm PDT
Sorry...one last question lol
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 5:42pm PDT
yes
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 5:42pm PDT
so we, for example, subtract 6.5 cm from 235.5cm?
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 5:40pm PDT
we included the distance from the actual launching position to the marked launching position on the launcher
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 5:38pm PDT
Anyone know what it means to subtract 6.5 CM from the horizontal distance?
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 5:36pm PDT
nice
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 5:36pm PDT
Yep. Pit that as the percent error.
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 5:36pm PDT
From the theoretical value
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 5:36pm PDT
Is it okay if we are one degree off?
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 6:36am PDT
Thx
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 6:28am PDT
Sorry. I assumed you all had this data.
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 6:27am PDT
then you can use the theta and height data for the rest of the lab
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 6:26am PDT
(you can use that to come up with v initial)
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 6:26am PDT
launch distance to subtract from horizontal distance: 6.5 cm
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 6:25am PDT
horizontal distance launched: 235.5 cm, 236.0 cm, 235.4 cm, 236.2 cm, 236.2 cm, 235.7 cm
Wednesday, October 5, 2016 at 6:24am PDT
vertical distance (table height) = 91.85 cm
Tuesday, October 4, 2016 at 8:43pm PDT
got it
Tuesday, October 4, 2016 at 8:43pm PDT
Make an angle vs height graph.
Tuesday, October 4, 2016 at 8:43pm PDT

Tuesday, October 4, 2016 at 8:42pm PDT
ya

Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 11:06pm PST
Yes, I'll give it to Ryan in 5th period unless you want to get it directly before that.
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 10:32pm PST
Don't forget about the SD card for tomorrow
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 7:27pm PST
 
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 7:18pm PST
It's good just that I really have to cut videos as short as possible because they take up way past 30 seconds
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 6:23pm PST
How the editing going?
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 1:49am PST
Ok I'm just going to turn it in on Friday so that I can make sure that it actually looks better than right now and get more points
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 12:24am PST
Omg same are they
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 12:23am PST
so are the ads due tmrw or friday? i think i remember him saying friday but it says 11/17 on school loop...
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 5:06pm PST
alright lol thanks, and sorry about that
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 5:06pm PST
it's ok haha. his instructions were very vague. i'll ask him about it tmrw :)
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 5:05pm PST
oh shoot
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 5:05pm PST
yeah but bc we picked trump as our candidate, negatives have to be supporting him and denouncing hillary (i.e. attack ads)
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 5:04pm PST
yeah i'm including clips that indicate trump's sexism and insensitivity
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 5:03pm PST
tbh i'm confused about this project
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 5:03pm PST
whatever
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 5:03pm PST
so that would be against hillary though? idk from one of your clips, you were insulting trump's treatment of women?
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 5:03pm PST
Nice
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 5:02pm PST
negative trump
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 5:02pm PST
all done! :) btw amit is yours a negative for hillary or trump?
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 4:56pm PST

Tuesday, November 15, 2016 at 12:13pm PST
We still need story
Tuesday, November 15, 2016 at 11:35am PST
Just so you know Bhavi can't come because she has meetings and other stuff ok
Tuesday, November 15, 2016 at 10:14am PST

Tuesday, November 15, 2016 at 10:08am PST
Alright
Tuesday, November 15, 2016 at 10:03am PST
We are going to meet up in front of the school, probably quietest area to record.
Tuesday, November 15, 2016 at 7:04am PST
Where are we meeting up for lunch?
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 11:37pm PST
aight ez money
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 11:37pm PST
negative trump?
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 11:35pm PST
Lily and Ryan are doing one positive and one negative ad so I'm guessing that a negative is left?
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 11:12pm PST
sp i believe thats one + ad
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 11:12pm PST
i did a pro-life ad for trump
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 11:11pm PST
I know it's 1 per person, but who has claimed which
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 11:11pm PST
so how are we divvying up the storyboard ads?
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 9:55pm PST
I think it supposed to be 30 seconds exact
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 9:45pm PST
ads are 30 seconds or more right
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 7:35pm PST
for my ad we are going to need to snip out 1:46-2:10 from this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oQ8wof3MA4
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 7:04pm PST
It is time taking but pretty trivial.
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 7:04pm PST
Thanks!
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 7:03pm PST
No it's due Wednesday
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 7:03pm PST
is show me the money due tomorrow?
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 7:02pm PST
We need to meet asap though since we only have 30 mins to get 3 ads recorded
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 7:02pm PST
:)
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 7:02pm PST
Sounds solid.
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 7:02pm PST
when we meet tmrw we can turn it in during 5th period
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 7:00pm PST
johnson said to turn all the group's work in together
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 7:00pm PST
I am assuming in each of our own respective classes, any preference where we should all meet up for lunch tomorrow?
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 6:59pm PST
who is going to turn all of them in together
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 6:58pm PST
Yea all the storyboards are due tmrw
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 6:57pm PST
I am doing one of the storyboards
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 6:56pm PST
Isnt the only thing due tomorrow the script
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:51pm PST
And if you want to incorporate too, I will be dressed as filthy Frank... It's for another project I have to do that day.
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:50pm PST
And if you want to incorporate too, I will love dressed as filthy Frank... It's for another project I have to do that day.
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:49pm PST
That is 10 per video in minutes we can allot to, so make sure for each story you know what needs done and or props
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:49pm PST
Lunch is about 30 mins and we got 3 ads to record
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:49pm PST
Lily if you have time to spare to help me that would be really helpful :D
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:49pm PST
I'm just worried about the time when we record.
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:48pm PST
Don't worry, you'll do great.
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:48pm PST
just as a note to others who may be doing a negative: i'm doing one regarding scare tactics and the negative side of hillary's policies/how they might not be feasible. i'll put it up here once i'm done so nobody else does the same thing (this isn't the same as the list of failures idea)
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:47pm PST
Then provide the recordings to kelly
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:47pm PST
For the storyboard I have we don't need to film it just to to merge some recordings of Donald trump rallies then narrate
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:45pm PST
Then tomorrow we all gotta meet up during lunch to film all four, I give the data to Kelly and she edits.
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:45pm PST
Just make sure you guys know which is doing which so we don't end up with 3 negatives and one positive.
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:44pm PST
Everyone will be making one to sum to 2 positive and 2 negative, Kelly is on editing, I am on filming.
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:44pm PST
i'll take the negative if it's all right with you :)
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:44pm PST
Yes
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:43pm PST
oh okay! so ryan and i are making one negative and one positive?
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:42pm PST
Kelly doesn't need to make one since she got enough on her plate with editing
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:42pm PST
btw kelly i can try helping you with editing the videos! i don't have a particular software on my laptop, but i'm checking out biteable and others and seeing if they can suit our needs
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 4:41pm PST
so kelly and bhavi are doing two positives, amit and andrew are doing one negative, and ryan and i are doing one negative then?
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 3:00pm PST
And we will have to make a place to meet and record it all
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 3:00pm PST
Just make sure everyone has a fully done storyboard which meets the requirements by tomorrow
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 2:51pm PST
I don't know how to edit videos
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 2:50pm PST
Just to make sure no one else knows editing ? Because if they do I could do storyboard in their places
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 2:49pm PST
Sure
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 2:47pm PST
We have to have all the storyboards done by today because that at best will allow two days for her to edit
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 2:47pm PST
Kelly has to finish editing and I gotta gather the people to record all the stuff
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 2:47pm PST
Each other person besides me and Kelly makes one.
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 2:46pm PST
So you two will make two
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 2:45pm PST
Oh yea me and lily are doing a positive ad storyboard fyi
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 2:43pm PST
We will record at lunch so that Kelly has ample time to edit the footage.
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 2:43pm PST
So we will be recording tomorrow, I will bring the camera and tri-pod, Kelly will do the editing, everyone else will have to participate in the video or make the storyboards.
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 12:53pm PST
Better than nothing, just tell me when I should being the camera beforehand.
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 12:40pm PST
I guess I or someone whose knows how to edit videos can do it, I don't have iMovie but I think that would help?
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 12:35pm PST
I can record but can't edit for #2
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 12:29pm PST
And we r doing 2 positives for trump
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 12:26pm PST
Tl;Dr Bhavi and I'll have 2, you guys just make sure to have 2 and well give it to u guys at lunch

We can come up with one more and then Bhavi and I will come up with 2 storyboards and hopefully we might give it to u guys around lunchtime so one period can turn it ib
Monday, November 14, 2016 at 12:18pm PST
Sorry I didn't say much, but if these two ideas ( one that you already storyboard es, and the abortion that Bhavi and I came up with) work, we still need 2 more ads

Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:34pm PST
yup
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:34pm PST
And if not we can still use them for the previous idea Ryan compiled.
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:34pm PST
yup sounds good
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:33pm PST
Just in case we do get that far
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:33pm PST
I'll ask and still bring the camera stuff.
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:33pm PST
I'd be more than happy to go along with it, but we've to cross it w johnson first
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:32pm PST
I kinda want to still ask if we could base it off Amit if you're good with that as a side add to promote your candidacy for in class.
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:32pm PST
i'm fine with those
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:29pm PST
I have no objection to it as long as everyone else agrees
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:29pm PST
Unless you have another idea we are open for different ones
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:28pm PST
So all four will be based of that?
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:27pm PST
Yes
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:27pm PST
All four?
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:26pm PST
This is just general ideas for each ad
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:26pm PST
 
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:16pm PST
They are pretty strait forward.
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:16pm PST
Just send whatever you four have done in pictures and we will either add or create the other three.
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:15pm PST
Storyboarding tho
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:15pm PST
Since Ryan provided that we will have a huge chunk of time in the class to work on it.
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:15pm PST
Darn, well tomorrow I will bring a camera for if we do have time to record.
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:14pm PST
Yea
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:14pm PST
Federal
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:14pm PST
Did he only say we can only do actual ones?
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:14pm PST
candidates of the class or of the federal election
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:14pm PST
The election candidates
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:14pm PST
For this project we just do the candidates sir
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:14pm PST
It is an ad for candidacy technically.
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:14pm PST
I'm sure we can do it.
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:12pm PST
oh is that an option?
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:12pm PST
Half as for the ad project but also to promote him to best the current in-class candidate?
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 8:12pm PST
Any opinion on instead having Amit be the person we record for?
Wednesday, November 9, 2016 at 3:17pm PST

Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 10:07pm PST
then you can update but otherwise
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 10:07pm PST
if bhavi responds later and nobody is editing
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 10:07pm PST
add in whatever you can
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 10:05pm PST
Hey just wondering, so for period 4, Bhavi actually has the polls and not May, but Bhavi hasnt been active on fb for almost a day, so do I still add in period 4's polls?
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:19pm PST
Thanks :)
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:19pm PST
everybody else, I'll need them soon
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:19pm PST
Samast, thank you for getting that done
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:19pm PST
PM me a description of your contribution as soon as possible
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:12pm PST
Making sure am i editing the main page or is someone else doing that?
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:11pm PST
ah i see
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:11pm PST
I havent received the polls yet.
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:11pm PST
@chrish can you tell me when you're done editing?
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:10pm PST
I have to do 6 so once we are done, do me a favor and give me a description of what bits you did and I'll add it to my assessment
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:10pm PST
yeah
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:09pm PST
so we only do 1, 4, 5 on the self eval right
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:09pm PST
fasho
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:08pm PST
at the end of it, I just need to loopmail him the link and as long as it redirects to the right place, we're okay
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:07pm PST
well if you feel it's not necessary, no worries
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:07pm PST
because free domain without extension is just better but we'll see
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:07pm PST
its already thursday
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:07pm PST
i think we can just leave it
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:07pm PST
as mentioned earlier, once all is done I'll figure out the domain situation
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 9:06pm PST
r we just keeping it at this domain
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 8:47pm PST
Alrighty
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 8:47pm PST
just extend the section i put fifth period in
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 8:16pm PST
I can add in the polls for fourth and sixth
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 7:46pm PST
makes sense
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 7:45pm PST
Well I think we should but like those who still need something to write in for the evaluation can add it in
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 7:44pm PST
should we put it or nah
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 7:42pm PST
Actually if u want polls for 4 period ask May and for 6 period ask Cathy
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 7:40pm PST
did no other classes do polls
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 6:50pm PST
and once this is final I'll worry about the domain situation
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 6:49pm PST
if all have done something they can write their evaluation about
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 6:49pm PST
and I'll take whatever is left later tonight
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 6:48pm PST
Johnson just fill out your evaluation as is
Thursday, December 15, 2016 at 6:48pm PST
Quick thing, I don't need to sign anything

ultimately the html will be accessible
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 9:09pm PST
cuz once u publish it all
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 9:08pm PST
i can rip the code from this and save it under my own custom domain

once this site is done
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 9:08pm PST
what we can do is
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 9:08pm PST
@lily, in terms of the domain, I can handle that
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 9:08pm PST
all right, you guys are admins now :) it looks super basic & we still don't have a custom domain (http://lilybhattacharjeec.wixsite.com/mock-election) but i suppose it'll suffice

myles**
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 9:00pm PST
if that works
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 8:59pm PST
Now what johnson told me is that im not supposed to do it because im the chair, but ill help anyway and we'll say I just oversaw the process
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 8:59pm PST
my code that I sent lily can be used as a base
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 8:59pm PST
because it will be faster
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 8:59pm PST
if all can't code, we can use wix
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 8:59pm PST
so because our site isn't an editorial, we'll have to put in something about miles as well to balance both parties
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 8:58pm PST
sorry for being mia today, had some problems with my health
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 8:57pm PST
Whichever is easier/quicker
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 8:56pm PST
i'm fine w/ that. do you guys still want to do github or is weebly/wix preferable? we may not have the time to code everything
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 8:55pm PST
on*
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 8:55pm PST
i think we should quickly recreate or wix or something
Tuesday, December 13, 2016 at 8:55pm PST
idk though bc none of us can edit w/o forking

Sunday, December 11, 2016 at 12:44am PST
but ill work with you all on that tmrw
Sunday, December 11, 2016 at 12:44am PST
or so he told me
Sunday, December 11, 2016 at 12:44am PST
cuz technically I'm just supposed to be overseeing the making of the site
Sunday, December 11, 2016 at 12:44am PST
he also told me I had to assign tasks so I'll do that tmrw
Sunday, December 11, 2016 at 12:43am PST
johnson said helping a candidate is fine but ill have to check with him
Saturday, December 10, 2016 at 7:45pm PST
Anthony is the head of newspaper
Saturday, December 10, 2016 at 7:45pm PST

Monday, November 28, 2016 at 5:31pm PST
biz.nf does some domains for free, we can just link it to a git repo
Monday, November 28, 2016 at 5:30pm PST
my thoughts exactly^
Monday, November 28, 2016 at 5:29pm PST
just throwing another idea out there: we can host on github pages (which will not automatically have a custom domain) or find a host & connect a custom domain to the repository [idk I'd like to avoid weebly if possible]
Monday, November 28, 2016 at 4:05pm PST
ill figure out a host and if we wanna use weebly, we can do that too
Monday, November 28, 2016 at 4:04pm PST
aite no worries
Monday, November 28, 2016 at 4:04pm PST

Some of those are big questions, but OK, I can finally believe that we are in "decent" shape (for a very loose definition of "decent").
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 6:45am PST
Remaining questions: 7, 9, 12, 13
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 6:42am PST
Green is complete, red is complete but has errors that need fixing, no highlight means incomplete.
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 6:42am PST
OK I'm going to the questions right now, and some of them seem to have mistakes, so I'm color-coding.
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 6:42am PST

Friday, December 9, 2016 at 12:10am PST
And I would rather have the song finalized by today so that we can get started over the weekend.
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 12:09am PST
My group still hasn't picked a song (because we finalized our group very late).
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 12:09am PST

Friday, December 9, 2016 at 12:09am PST
is that due?
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 12:09am PST

Friday, December 9, 2016 at 12:09am PST
I can do that.
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 12:09am PST
who wants to work on it with me
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 12:09am PST
If it's not in the folder, I would assume we aren't done. And when I say "not done," I mean "not started."
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 12:09am PST
oh HAHA ok
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 12:08am PST

Senators are more frequently policy generalists, while Reps are more frequently policy specialists.
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 12:06am PST
I think Senate usually focuses more on foreign policy (since it ratifies treaties).
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 12:03am PST
😪
Friday, December 9, 2016 at 12:03am PST
i cant find policymaking focus for house & senate

Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 10:23pm PST
OK GUYS
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 7:28pm PST
we could use slides, and just share w him?
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 7:28pm PST
idk tbh
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 7:28pm PST
Because I think we need to put lots of images and text boxes.
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 7:28pm PST
Would it be easier on Slides or Doc?
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 7:28pm PST
it seems fairly easy if we split it up?

Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 7:27pm PST
this is how my friend did theirs
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 7:27pm PST
we could do it on google docs and just paste images and info
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:39pm PST
If it did, I think pretty much every group would be screwed, because I have not seen anybody working together on artsy stuff.
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:39pm PST
According to Mr. Johnson, it doesn't HAVE to be drawn.
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:38pm PST
I thought we had to draw it???
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:36pm PST
Are we doing it on Google Slides?
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:36pm PST
How are we making the flowchart?
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:07pm PST
If there isn't really anything special about the setup of the house of cards, then just turn in the deck of cards.
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:06pm PST
and send the video to Mr. Johnson.
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:06pm PST
but take a video recording of the house of cards after assembling it at home,
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:06pm PST
turn in the deck of cards,
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:06pm PST
If the house of cards has some extra visual appeal, what I would recommend is this:
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:00pm PST
Well, I don't think turning it in to Johnson would be the issue, as people have made 3-d things in the past that couldn't directly be placed in the box, like shirts or dodecahedrons, but I guess I'll just go with the deck then. It's simpler.
Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 7:36pm PST
I guess just in a box of cards
Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 7:35pm PST
Well, a deck can be turned in easily.
Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 7:35pm PST
That sounds great, but how would we turn it in to Johnson?
Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 7:34pm PST
I'm trying to make a house of cards :) w/ each of the cards (well, at least the visible faces) showing & describing 1 way to kill the bill. If the final structure doesn't end up standing, I'll just make a card deck. I'll upload a picture when it's done.
Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 2:06pm PST
@Anisha and Lily: what are you guys planning to do for the other two things?
Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 2:04pm PST
Everyone other than Lily and Anisha (because I know the two of you are working on the other two things) needs to help out with the flowchart.
Wednesday, December 7, 2016 at 2:03pm PST
This has the necessary information that we will need for the flowchart (mainly the dynamic lawmaking processes, because the other stuff can be found without too much difficulty).

Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:22pm PST
Some of the questions are answered more directly in the PPT, if I remember correctly (although I don't remember what the answers are), and it would be much easier than scouring the book, especially since Chapter 13 is so big.
Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 9:22pm PST
I ask because I think it would make our lives much easier.

In my process of searching for answers to my questions, I am usually finding answers to other people's questions, so I am often filling those in.

In the locker I can only find the "Old" Congress PowerPoint, which is not what he's showing us now.
Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 4:13pm PST
Does anybody know where the Congress Powerpoint is?
Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 3:15pm PST
Not in the Google doc.
Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 3:15pm PST
So to know what part you are responsible for, look in the blank Word doc and see the page numbers there.
Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 3:15pm PST
I just realized that the page numbers are going to get messed up when we add stuff to the doc.
Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 3:08pm PST
Because we still need to do that artsy stuff at the end.
Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 3:08pm PST
I don't think any page should take more than 30 minutes, if that much.
Sunday, December 4, 2016 at 3:08pm PST
Try to do as much as you can of your page today.

Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 9:26am PDT
Hey guys the script is due in two days
Friday, May 19, 2017 at 1:17pm PDT
If any of you check the sign up sheet you'll see that I've registered our group for a song several days ago. If someone has an objection to the one chosen, please change it or suggest something else because we need to work on lyrics over the weekend and everything is set in stone by Tuesday. By Monday morning, we should have everything at least 90% ready.
Wednesday, May 17, 2017 at 10:00pm PDT
did we pick one?
Tuesday, May 16, 2017 at 1:33pm PDT
Bea and mauli can choose the song as they have good choices
Tuesday, May 16, 2017 at 1:32pm PDT
Song choice is due today! Bea (or anyone else), do you have any ideas?
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 2:27pm PDT
It doesn't really matter as long as the information is there
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 2:27pm PDT
But if anyone else has a song in mind then just send it to the group chat
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 2:26pm PDT
I think we agreed that Bea can list some songs for us to pick from since she has a great taste in music :)
Friday, May 12, 2017 at 6:18pm PDT
Also, what song are you all interested in? Apparently, we need to have a final script next-to-next Tuesday...
Friday, May 12, 2017 at 6:16pm PDT
Hi guys! (I hope there isn't already a chat for this project) So a lot of people have been claiming topics for the AP Econ song & I've registered us for foreign exchange, appreciation / depreciation so we wouldn't run out of options. If you'd like to change that, you're welcome to.

Nikita, you still need to choose your team. We can send out the announcement this weekend at the same time we announce officer applications.
Friday, May 20, 2016 at 8:56am PDT
Okaaaay so. The insanity yesterday has led Mrs W to decide that we need core teams after all before the end of the school year.

WOOOO
Thursday, May 19, 2016 at 10:47am PDT
oh I'm not sure if everyone knows, but Wheaton is unable to be our advisor for Science and Eco next year (she is overwhelmed with being a mom to her kids and teaching so many classes at AHS), BUT Mr. Navarette has agreed to be our advisor next year! A few other teachers have said they would want to help us out so next year will hopefully be even bigger, better, and more organized than this year 󾌰
Thursday, May 19, 2016 at 10:43am PDT
Yeah, understandable. We may ask Navarrete to come and help, as well as some other teachers who have said they are interested in helping with recycling next year! We should show them the process anyway XD
Thursday, May 19, 2016 at 10:43am PDT
Well Dhruv wasn't here so there was less management
Thursday, May 19, 2016 at 10:42am PDT
Yeah I'll come by next week for sort and help you manage, sorry I took Wheaton away cuz we were handling money stuff for Maker Faire
Thursday, May 19, 2016 at 10:42am PDT
Omg yeah at the end of the year everything always goes to pieces >____<
Thursday, May 19, 2016 at 10:36am PDT
I guess we shall watch them more strictly next time?
Thursday, May 19, 2016 at 10:35am PDT
And a bunch of collect kids dumped trash and a few more brought everything in the last 2 minutes

hey guys, if any of you have small glass jars (like baby food, sauce jars), please let me know if i can take them! I'm making succulents for Reuse's maker faire and would love to have more. however, the glass jars MUST be somewhat short (otherwise the plants' roots cant get to the water!), so unfortunately, jam jars and tomato sauce jars wont work. if you're unsure, please take a pic and send it to me and i'll let you know. I need these BEFORE Friday! Thank you thank you! <3

i don't think i've gotten any notification that i was reimbursed now that i think of it...
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 9:05pm PDT
um. I gave Dhruv my receipts a long time ago.
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 9:04pm PDT
ALSO we'll be handling reimbursements and purchases!! SO DHRUV please come to get info and bring your forms and receipts :) and MAY and ENYA/Reuse and NIKITA! please come prepared with what you would like to purchase and an approximation of how much you would like to spend, as well as any other receipts you have that need to be reimbursed.
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 9:03pm PDT
but everyone else, PLEASE COME! we'll be voting for executive officer positions. how decision making is going to work this year is voting will be taken into account, but it is not the final decision (because this year there is a LOT of applicants and we dont want to turn this into a popularity contest).
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 9:02pm PDT
What is it about?
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 9:01pm PDT

@adrian, okay! i'll have an intern substitute for you!
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:48pm PDT
but i doubt it, especially since we dont have our sort captains there
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:48pm PDT
I cannot be there. I have Calculus exam.
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:48pm PDT
and IF we have more ppl than expected, then we may want to do sort
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:48pm PDT
YES we may need to use interns as extra substitutes
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:48pm PDT
since our recyclers are largely juniors and seniors and many will be in calc
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:47pm PDT
Lots of substitutes?
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:47pm PDT
EVERYONE be on collect
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:47pm PDT
yeah, so here's my plan for thursday:
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:47pm PDT
when kathryn and i went to go ask for more last friday
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:47pm PDT
And most officers will be gone Thursday, as a reminder
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:47pm PDT
we have like 10 bags left in the shed right now from what the janitors could give us.
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:47pm PDT
Speaking of which we have none rn
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:45pm PDT
OH no wonder kathryn and i couldnt find it; the bag wasn't see through. BTW the janitors told us that from now on, they're only gonna be getting black trash bags and if we need a large amount of them, we'll have to start paying for them ourselves. They money isnt an issue since our recycling gives us plenty of funds, but we want see-through clear bags so we know what we recycled and all that. So kathryn and I will be looking into where to start purchasing our own
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:43pm PDT
Black bag/garbage bin
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:43pm PDT
I THINK we left it in the shed (90% sure)
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:42pm PDT
Excellent! :) Where did you put them?
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:42pm PDT
Yes we did
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:41pm PDT
Question @Andrew and @Dhruv - did you guys collect clean water bottles last week?
Monday, May 2, 2016 at 10:41pm PDT

Thursday, April 28, 2016 at 2:49pm PDT
Yeah so I was thinking on that week, no sort, just store unsorted bottles and cans in the small shed. We'll still need bags tho
Thursday, April 28, 2016 at 2:49pm PDT
As will Dhruv and Kathryn, so Recycling might be a problem
Thursday, April 28, 2016 at 2:47pm PDT

Hey guys! I've been shredding the white paper we've collected all afternoon, but my shredder is now malfunctioning. As a result, collecting white paper will be less critical tomorrow. If teachers give you giant stacks of mostly-clean paper, feel free to take them, since we can probably use them for something else, but otherwise don't sweat it. :)

Also, keep in mind that you are only allowed to represent one club during the lip dub :)
Wednesday, March 23, 2016 at 3:24pm PDT
ALSO we need to know if any of you would like to be in the middle, being the main ones lip syncing while all the club members are on the side (like what saahil, Tara, and Marcus were doing). Does anyone really wanna do it? Otherwise, Kathryn and I were thinking of doing it together. I think we're allowed to have a few more ppl in the center, but not too many :)
Wednesday, March 23, 2016 at 3:24pm PDT
What they described at the meeting sounded super fun. I'm all for it. :D
Wednesday, March 23, 2016 at 3:23pm PDT

If you don't kno what a lip dub is, its basically just a fun video to show off your school

Alright. Sounds good.
Tuesday, March 22, 2016 at 4:18pm PDT
Its okay Adrian, you don't have to come. This is primarily for ppl who will be training interns :)
Tuesday, March 22, 2016 at 4:13pm PDT
 
Tuesday, March 22, 2016 at 4:13pm PDT
I express interest in being a recycling captain, though. What should I do?
Tuesday, March 22, 2016 at 4:12pm PDT
Since you are an intern yourself, you don't need to come! We mainly just need the captains of the various teams (and our secretary of course, thanks lily!)
Tuesday, March 22, 2016 at 4:08pm PDT
Denise what can I do there?
Tuesday, March 22, 2016 at 4:08pm PDT
Let me know if you CANNOT come :)
Tuesday, March 22, 2016 at 4:08pm PDT
Okay guys!!! Meeting at lunch at 507 TMRW to meet and train the new interns!!!
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:52pm PDT
So true :) you guys are amazing
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:52pm PDT
 
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:51pm PDT
we tried to choose ppl who are enthusiastic and passionate but also have potential to grow and learn a lot! (just like what we looked for when you guys were selected <3 )
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:50pm PDT
any questions, concerns, etc let me know :D
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:50pm PDT
if you note the post that kathryn will be making soon on the general science and eco page, we are going to try to have a meeting this week to meet interns and talk about what's gonna happen next!
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:49pm PDT
I can try.
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:49pm PDT
but for example, reuse and recycling will have interns
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:49pm PDT
not all of us officers have an intern
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:49pm PDT
BUT we will need you guys to help train them in various positions
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:49pm PDT
this does not gurantee they will be an officer
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:48pm PDT
and to train new potential officers in future years
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:48pm PDT
That is good to know.
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:48pm PDT
the purpose of interns is to give members more opportunity to learn more about our club
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:48pm PDT
please note THEY WILL NOT REPLACE YOU GUYS this year or next year
Monday, March 21, 2016 at 10:48pm PDT
coooooool!!!!!!!

OKAY GUYS BIG NEWS
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 11:01am PDT
So stay on the lookout haha. Thanks!
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 11:01am PDT
ALSO IMPORTANT! we need you to IDENTIFY who they are! If we know their names, we can find them and warn them, etc
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:54am PDT
We are trying to be stricter due to more and more people not doing work and being disruptive instead. So don't be afraid to speak up to them!! Thanks everyone :)
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:53am PDT
If anyone doesn't listen to you, tell Kathryn, me, Andrew, or Ms. Wheaton. If there's a repetitive problem, we can tell their teacher to no longer let them come to recycling.
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:53am PDT
Also, keep warning people about being noisy!!
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:52am PDT
but that goes for everyone as well. If people are not doing work, YOU CAN cross out their names on the sign in sheets. Tell them if they don't do work, they don't get hours!!
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:52am PDT
Lol I used other subs for you just so you know. BUT MAY we had slackers for your area today so watch out for that if they come back

Okay, we'll continue to try to be stricter. We were short on people this week due to the DECA field trip so we'll probably do more monitoring of wanderers next week, so don't worry. Today, I already saw a lot more improvement from last week :) so keep up the good work guys :D
Thursday, March 3, 2016 at 12:28pm PST
What shall we do if this trend continues?
Thursday, March 3, 2016 at 12:27pm PST
Recycling went well but we still have issues of people wandering around and doing nothing. Michelle told me something about two members staying like sitting ducks at 500 wing so the bins at 325 and 328 did not get picked up. :(

Wednesday, March 2, 2016 at 2:43pm PST
The new interns are solely to help those officers such as gardening, who need extra help and to also encourage regular science club members to become more involved in our activities! :)
Wednesday, March 2, 2016 at 2:42pm PST
Oh haha I haven't even thought of that yet. But yes, I wouldn't assume so that you can get different positions next year. I wouldn't say its promoted because everyone's position is important :) ultimately, its up to Kathryn and Ms. Wheaton, etc to decide how they would like to run things next year regarding officers :)

Thursday, February 25, 2016 at 2:40pm PST
Is anyone else coming to open house?
Thursday, February 25, 2016 at 2:39pm PST
The main synopsis of our compost plan to those who missed the meeting. May, Denise, and Kathryn planned this out earlier. All we need is to publicize our compost program.
Thursday, February 25, 2016 at 2:37pm PST
 
Thursday, February 25, 2016 at 10:05am PST

Wednesday, February 24, 2016 at 3:10pm PST
 
Wednesday, February 24, 2016 at 3:10pm PST
Also btw guys, if you're at open house for another club anyway, please divide your time to science and eco as well, even if its just a few minutes, it will be much appreciated :)
Wednesday, February 24, 2016 at 3:09pm PST
 
Wednesday, February 24, 2016 at 3:09pm PST

Wednesday, February 24, 2016 at 3:08pm PST

Wednesday, February 24, 2016 at 3:07pm PST
After i help him of course.
Wednesday, February 24, 2016 at 3:07pm PST
I got it. As soon as sort starts, i will run off to when i usually go. Is that fine?
Wednesday, February 24, 2016 at 3:06pm PST
If you do though, sure that's fine!
Wednesday, February 24, 2016 at 3:06pm PST
You're the best! Thanks Andrew :) Adrian, we still need you to collect data from the paper bins, so I'm not sure if you will have time.
Wednesday, February 24, 2016 at 3:05pm PST
Can i help him?
Wednesday, February 24, 2016 at 3:05pm PST
Yeah ok, will be fine
Wednesday, February 24, 2016 at 3:05pm PST

Agreed :)
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 8:55pm PST
For the most part I say the recycling team did great this year. :D Few tweaks and we are good.
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 8:54pm PST
Cracking down is part of being an officer ;)
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 8:32pm PST
If they don't listen to u, send them to Wheaton, Kathryn, or me >:)
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 8:32pm PST
 
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 8:32pm PST
Please remind recyclers to be quiet as classes are in session.
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 8:32pm PST

Tuesday, February 16, 2016 at 11:17pm PST
Hey guys! Would any of you be free tomorrow at lunch to watch over and direct composting in the rotunda?
Thursday, February 11, 2016 at 12:19pm PST
 
Thursday, February 11, 2016 at 10:47am PST
Please remember that is this a very rare situation, but I just wanted to make sure you guys know what to do if any if this happens to you on campus, even it is not during recycling :)
Thursday, February 11, 2016 at 10:46am PST
Also, there was a situation today where one of the recyclers had a panic attack. It was good that their friend told me immediately and I was able to find Mrs. Melsby immediately. Please note that if there is ever an emergency (someone faints, is sick, asthma attack, anything) please tell me, Kathryn, or Wheaton if we are nearby, or if not, seek out an adult as quickly as you can. Please do not panic because that makes others even more nervous/worried and can worsen the situation. Find any if the administrators or a teacher as soon as you can.
Thursday, February 11, 2016 at 10:42am PST
Please continue to look :) I kno today was a little crazy cuz of the food but please do your best to keep asking around and keep training them on what to do :)
Thursday, February 11, 2016 at 10:42am PST
NIKITA: Chanel liang has agreed to be your substitute !! :)
Wednesday, February 10, 2016 at 6:29pm PST
 
Wednesday, February 10, 2016 at 6:29pm PST
Thanks everyone :)
Wednesday, February 10, 2016 at 6:26pm PST
Btw ankita, Sarah Mukwatil (I think that's her last name) has agreed to be you substitute. But I remember that u may have another person as well (please confirm with her)
Wednesday, February 10, 2016 at 6:25pm PST
If you already have substitutes who said yes, start training them this week!!
Wednesday, February 10, 2016 at 6:25pm PST
 
Wednesday, February 10, 2016 at 6:25pm PST
Please don't forget to continue looking for substitutes!!
Wednesday, February 10, 2016 at 6:25pm PST
Absent*
Wednesday, February 10, 2016 at 6:24pm PST
Thanks for letting me know! Everyone else, please let me know if you will be aabsent
Wednesday, February 10, 2016 at 6:24pm PST
I have a dentists appointment tomorrow, so I can't be at recycling tomorrow
Wednesday, February 3, 2016 at 5:59pm PST
Lolol if you can't find it, ask Kathryn :)
Wednesday, February 3, 2016 at 5:58pm PST
Some luck at last lol
Wednesday, February 3, 2016 at 5:58pm PST
Oh thank god :)
Wednesday, February 3, 2016 at 5:57pm PST
OH BTW ANDREW a custodian left the GOOD plastic bags in Wheaton's room, in the lab, in boxes against the wall on the right (from when you enter the labs)
Wednesday, February 3, 2016 at 5:57pm PST
Don't forget to send them to me in the rotunda if you have someone who's interested
Wednesday, February 3, 2016 at 5:56pm PST
If they have ppl in mind :)
Wednesday, February 3, 2016 at 5:56pm PST
Please continue to look for underclassmen substitutes! If you don't have underclassmen in your group, ask other wing captains!
Wednesday, February 3, 2016 at 5:56pm PST
Yep
Wednesday, February 3, 2016 at 5:56pm PST
 
Wednesday, February 3, 2016 at 5:56pm PST
Ready for tmrw?

Hey guys!
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 9:55am PST
 
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 6:38pm PST
O btw, if you find someone tmrw and they agree, please send them to meet me in the rotunda! I wanna introduce myself, give them the basics of their job, and get contact info :) thanks!
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 6:25pm PST
 
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 6:25pm PST
Thank you :)
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 6:24pm PST
It would be nice if they could be freshmen and sophomores, so that recycling will have strong leaders for the next few years after we graduate!
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 6:24pm PST
 
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 6:24pm PST
For everyone else, don't forget to be on the lookout for substitutes tmrw! Look for kids that have been showing up very regularly, and seem responsible and are outgoing and other leadership qualities!
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 6:22pm PST
But its up to you! Do the solution you think is best :)
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 6:00pm PST
I'm just wondering if we will ever get sturdier bags. Cuz I think that's basically the bags that the custodians have been using all year for the whole school if you noticed what they used on our regular trash cans.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:58pm PST
We usually don't have enough glass bottles to fill up the bag, we could just leave the bag with the bottles in the bin until we get sturdier bags
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:57pm PST
Got it.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:57pm PST
We should have lots of extra paper bins in the back. It will take up more space in the shed, but safety first!
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:56pm PST
Recycle in exchange for money I mean**
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:56pm PST
Hmmmm then for glass, don't use a bag but use a bin. When we take it to recycle, we can distribute small amounts of glass bottles into bags instead.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:55pm PST
O shoot :( yeah that's a good solution if you have to, for the bins from classrooms that tend to have a lot of bottles as well
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:54pm PST
Biggest fear is the glass bag, that could be really bad
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:54pm PST
I've had a bag burst once
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:53pm PST
They can't hold as much weight as our older bags, so we may have to double bag them
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:53pm PST
Oh okay yay thanks! Wat do you mean pretty weak? D:
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:50pm PST
So I don't think we need more just yet
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:50pm PST
I got a bunch of bags last time, but they're pretty weak
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:50pm PST
Do we need more bags? (If so, Andrew or Dhruv or whoever knows how to do it, please ask the custodians before we start sort!) thanks :)
Tuesday, January 26, 2016 at 6:36pm PST
See the FB post on the officer page for details, if you weren't at the meeting! Thanks guys!
Tuesday, January 26, 2016 at 6:35pm PST
I will try to recruit more people as much as I can. And I got it.
Tuesday, January 26, 2016 at 6:35pm PST
But everyone else, please remember to look for a recycling substitute this Thursday :)
Tuesday, January 26, 2016 at 6:35pm PST
 
Tuesday, January 26, 2016 at 6:34pm PST
Okay because Kathryn and i haven't yet created an intern application but I'm glad to Kno you've found some potential people!
Tuesday, January 26, 2016 at 6:34pm PST
She could be.
Tuesday, January 26, 2016 at 6:33pm PST
You mean your substitute for recycling?
Tuesday, January 26, 2016 at 6:33pm PST
I asked her and she wants to.
Tuesday, January 26, 2016 at 6:33pm PST
 
Tuesday, January 26, 2016 at 6:33pm PST
I found a potential intern. Say hello to Kim; she is very interested in being an officer.
Tuesday, January 26, 2016 at 12:31pm PST
Actually 318
Monday, January 25, 2016 at 8:49pm PST
Awesome!
Monday, January 25, 2016 at 8:49pm PST

Monday, January 25, 2016 at 6:52pm PST

So please come if you can! 󾰀
Monday, January 25, 2016 at 6:17pm PST
SUPER COOL OPPORTUNITY GUYS! So ASB worked with this guy named James Perez from an organization called Safe Routes for their Cocoa for Carpools thing. He wants to work on a lot of events for AHS that aim to improve carbon emissions and are good for our environment and stuff 󾌵 And ASB has asked us if we would like to be a part of it! If you're interested (special events coordinator! Ankita! And if you're in ASB! :) ) there will be a super short meeting tmrw in Fulton's room during lunch. That's room 317 I think
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:42pm PST
 
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:41pm PST
It was LOTS of time and effort, and a bit talent and interest in the subject, and sheer luck as well
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:39pm PST
Seriously? >:(
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:38pm PST
crucible test is a lot of matching quotes apparently! we must study book intensely
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:35pm PST
So, Denise, how did you manage to do well in English last year? I admit. I am terrible at this subject.
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:32pm PST
Alright... I forgot.
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:30pm PST
Definitely get a good night's sleep and eat a healthy breakfast before your AP Lang final for sure. If you're nervous or tired or can't focus, lots of studying will not be as effective!
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:29pm PST
POAS scares me right now.
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:29pm PST
I am literally close to a B and I do not want to mess up.
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:28pm PST
True :D
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:27pm PST
Probably my biggest concern about finals is definitely AP English. I am reading The Crucible right now. Regardless, at least you got through it. :D
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:26pm PST
Lol apush. The biggest challenge about finals for me is staying focused. Why so many questions lol -____-
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:25pm PST
Apush was meh
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:25pm PST
Oh... You'll do fine.
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:24pm PST

Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:24pm PST
ha not us history w rojas D:<<
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:24pm PST
Nice. AP Physics was so time consuming. Took me the entire period. U.S. History was a piece of cake, though.
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:23pm PST
it was easy? woo some people said it was hard and i was worried
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:23pm PST
Chem was..... well it's chem
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:23pm PST
Ap bio was easy guys so @May and anyone else that will have it dw just study the study guide well 󾌵
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:22pm PST
So how are the finals so far?
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:20pm PST
 
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:20pm PST
So don't worry about it, it's not too urgent. Also just fyi, I'll be doing recycling hours and gardening hours on Thursday so everyone should be getting those soon :)
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:20pm PST
We need to recruit some freshmen and sophomores to be future officers since we noticed that this year's officers are juniors and seniors only.
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:19pm PST
Oh right, so ill be posting about that tmrw since I don't have finals on Friday XD
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:19pm PST
Yup cuz finals schedule doesn't have read so no recycling
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:18pm PST
OH guys what happened during officer meeting?
Wednesday, January 20, 2016 at 8:18pm PST
no recycling this week right?

Monday, January 18, 2016 at 9:00pm PST
Whatever, Kathryn deserved it because she is great. :)
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 8:52pm PST
*was.
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 8:52pm PST
Had a way to get pass it by how hardworking she is.
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 8:51pm PST
?
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 8:51pm PST
She somewhat had a way to circumvent around the difficulty of the class...
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 8:50pm PST
but its dope

Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:52pm PST
Haha yup!
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:52pm PST
That really sucks. But you are right. I remember how Garima said something about the importance of sleep and health over studies at one point...
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:51pm PST
But that's true for any final I guess XD
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:50pm PST
And whatever you do, try to get a good night's sleep cuz I Kno I get hecka bored taking the test so I lose focus and screw up since its so long.
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:50pm PST
Definitely true. That always gets me every time!
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:49pm PST
If there's no writing, I think i was okay on time. But definitely give yourself extra time to read the passages for the AP style multiple choice. those passages can be long and boring so its easy to misinterpret things!
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:49pm PST
lol im just gonna make sure i get 100 on the vocab so i can completely bomb the other 2 because ima have a B even if i get like a 60/250 nd theres no way i can get an A
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:49pm PST
Yeah I looked at old AP tests
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:49pm PST
Hm Denise covered pretty much everything
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:48pm PST
@ Denise: Thank you very much.
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:48pm PST
Denise was it a time crunch or did you have enough time to finish both the tests?
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:48pm PST
You can do it Adrian!
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:48pm PST
oh alright good luck studying
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:47pm PST
My grade is at 77.53% by the way.
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:47pm PST
No problem!
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:47pm PST
My! I have a lot of work to do! Thank you anyway, Denise.
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:47pm PST
adrian whats ur grade
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:46pm PST
Bhavya, any other tips?
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:46pm PST
Take it for practice and check your answers afterwards if you have the time.
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:45pm PST
Also, look up old AP tests to see how the questions are asked and what the format looks like
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:45pm PST
And examples of how they are used, especially if you did not really understand them in that first rhetorical terms quiz
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:45pm PST
It is also a good idea to review your rhetorical terms and make sure you really understand what those mean
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:44pm PST
Definitely go over your old notes about the background of the crucible and such. I found it helpful to actually watch a recording of the play because I was able to notice some details I hadn't seen before (but, only do this if you have time). Follow along with your copy of the play, and take note of any rhetorical devices you see used, like symbolism and imagery and everything else you have been studying.
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:42pm PST
The Crucible test and AP style questions, both multiple choice.
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:41pm PST
Wat did she say will be on it?
Monday, January 18, 2016 at 7:41pm PST

hey guys! hope you're all not dying too much because of finals. So wheaton has been telling me that because we DONT have assigned wing captains (meaning ya'll usually take whichever assignment you want), bins are not being consistently picked up and are getting lost. So, she would like assigned wing captains. I'll send out the list on fb and email, and please let me know if you would prefer something else

Who has wheaton 4th period? Or has a class in those science classrooms by 507? We will need someone to bring the sweatshirts to the flagpole. It will be fastest that way, but i could do it as well.

Wednesday, November 11, 2015 at 10:31pm PST
oh yeah did anyone find out where the library sign in sheet went?
Wednesday, November 11, 2015 at 10:30pm PST
oh and another thing, i've been noticing that officers have been switching assignments for the different areas. please try to choose the same collect area each week so your collect ppl will be more consistent (kids tend to choose the same officer each week right?) it will be easier to figure out problems that way--like how wheaton's room is always getting missed XD thank you~

Man, this might take recycling a bit longer.
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:44pm PDT
DONT FORGET TO COUNT YOURSELVES 󾍇
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:43pm PDT
Ppl who didn't dress up can leave first.

Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:43pm PDT
May: Everyone meets in the rotunda, then I will ask everyone who has dressed up for spirit week to stay. Then I will direct them to divide by grade and will ask some officers to help me count them up.

Millard?
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:41pm PDT
Same goes for Larry
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:41pm PDT
If we could get double points from Wheaton, it would help all the classes.
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:40pm PDT
LOLOL
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:40pm PDT
Don't rely on him to participate in Spirit Week
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:40pm PDT
Yep. So it's okay guys, we'll count manually and try to get them to count it with double points, as if Wheaton will be our fourth period "teacher"
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:40pm PDT
He's "forgetful"
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:40pm PDT
Melosh? Really?
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:39pm PDT
And Melosh
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:39pm PDT
Yeah! We can keep fairness that way, but it might be cumbersome.

Nikita, I'm afraid ppl might forget or try to lie about the #s
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:39pm PDT
Every teacher will have to remember then
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:39pm PDT
Everyone meets in the rotunda, then I will ask everyone who has dressed up for spirit week to stay. Then I will direct them to divide by grade and will ask some officers to help me count them up.
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:39pm PDT
how about before they leave for recycling, the students in their 4th period can note the people who left and were dressed up
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:38pm PDT
Spirit Week is confusing lol
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:38pm PDT
It is going to be very confusing.
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:38pm PDT
Okay I'm gonna re write what will be happening tmrw.
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:38pm PDT
How is this going to work?
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:37pm PDT
I am not too sure if your idea works. The ASB will eventually know that some people are gone in classrooms.
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:37pm PDT

^^^^
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:37pm PDT
;)
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:37pm PDT
I can just bring a black jacket ask her to put it on
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:37pm PDT
If we even can
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:36pm PDT
LOL ummmmm
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:36pm PDT
Might be a good idea Kathryn
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:36pm PDT
Yeah, if we have to write it down manually.... Will take too long to count up
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:36pm PDT
Yeah can we just use Wheaton?
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:36pm PDT
Numbers*
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:36pm PDT
But how will we get all the names submitted in time?
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:36pm PDT
Can we just have Wheaton be our dress-up person?
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:35pm PDT
I have to go count dress ups
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:35pm PDT
I don't think I can come to recycling tmrw
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:35pm PDT
im not totally sure how you guys do it at sort
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:35pm PDT
for collect anyway
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:35pm PDT
somehow check or count who dressed up and next to their name write their teacher
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:35pm PDT
when they check in
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:35pm PDT
I HAVE AN IDEA
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:35pm PDT
Robbing credit for dressups...
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:35pm PDT
wait wait wait
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
So I think we won't be able to do double points ...
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
Then it seems unfair otherwise
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
how will we know which teachers they come from though
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
󾌣
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
Tara didnt say anything about the teachers
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
Got it.
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
To count teachers
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
Lol yes yes and yes to everyone
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
Uhhhhh that's going to be hard
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
Wait Adrian, to clarify, before everyone leaves to sort and collect, I will ask people to separate by grades and we count.
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
Split them up by grades and then count
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
The doubling bonus?
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
Yes I was about to say that Enya ^
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
What about teachers though?
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:34pm PDT
wait since they count by grades, we should split them up by grades to count?
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:33pm PDT
Or someone else.
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:33pm PDT
Oh. Maybe before we leave for sort or collect team, maybe let Tara count.
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:33pm PDT
Yes, I will be counting but I may ask some of you to help me count as well, so we can double check :)
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:33pm PDT
I can announce it and help out
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:33pm PDT
 
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:32pm PDT

Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:32pm PDT
PLEASE HELP ME MAKE SURE NO ONE LEAVES THE ROTUNDA BEFORE WE FINISH COUNTING
Wednesday, October 21, 2015 at 9:32pm PDT
GUYS Tara (ASB pres) has told me that I should count up recyclers for spirit week dress up!
Monday, October 19, 2015 at 6:30pm PDT
Yup! And according to what happened today, I think it's about the same amount of time as well: 20 minutes :)
Monday, October 19, 2015 at 12:23pm PDT
I am certain that we will do because read still happens.
Monday, October 19, 2015 at 11:34am PDT

EVERYONE please keep in mind that because different teachers are excusing us, it might get kinda of crazy with kids being late and whatnot so please bear with us and do your best to get everything collected and dumped. Thank you all! (Don't forget to have checkin points with your group and double check your areas!) :)

Thursday, October 15, 2015 at 3:33pm PDT
YES Andrew would you like to post in the fb group? Just say: we are having recycling during third period READ tmrw! Your teachers should have received an email excusing you, but if they do not let you go, we understand.
Thursday, October 15, 2015 at 3:31pm PDT
Please ask your third period teachers to excuse you, but if they won't, we understand as you can't come cuz of the weird rescheduling due to the earthquake drill.
Thursday, October 15, 2015 at 3:31pm PDT
Ok. Shall we inform the whole recycling group?
Thursday, October 15, 2015 at 3:30pm PDT

Okay, so Bhavi can be our ambassador and can just ask Denise/Wheaton/me for clarifications if necessary. 󾌵
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:14pm PDT
I am pretty new at this but with lily sure
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:14pm PDT
Like would you be able to answer questions about how Recycling works?
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:13pm PDT
I think Andrew is probably busy directing Collect... Andrew?
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:13pm PDT
What do u mean
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:13pm PDT
Bhavi, would you like to show our guest around? Do you think you could explain our system?
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:12pm PDT
How about Andrew?
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:11pm PDT
:)
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:11pm PDT
Okay, gotcha. So Sort is me, Emily, Anne, ?Bhavi?, ...?
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:10pm PDT
I'm actually in charge of collect for the back of the school.
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:07pm PDT
 
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:02pm PDT
I think it would probably be important for you to direct Collect, so maybe Saurav could show our guest around, and at our respective locations we could let them shadow us?
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:01pm PDT
Many of the officers are needed for collection soooo
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:00pm PDT
I could do it tho but I think sort needed my assistance on Thursday, so entirely up to you Kathryn!
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:00pm PDT
 
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 3:00pm PDT
Agreed, Kathryn and Wheaton and Adrian are all busy. Ideally, we would want someone who will be there next year as well, so that a relationship could be built between us and stop waste
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 2:59pm PDT
Ahha! Hi Denise! What do you think?
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 2:59pm PDT
I'm going to be directing Sort, so probably not. Mrs. Wheaton offered to be ambassador, but it would be nice to have a student explain a student-run program. @Saurav: if I remember correctly, you're Sort. Would you be willing to show our guest around?
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 2:57pm PDT
Can you do it, the role of an ambassador?
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 2:56pm PDT
Alright.
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 2:54pm PDT
That's very kind, Adrian, but we need you to keep collecting data. I'll talk to Denise at MASN tonight.
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 12:17pm PDT
I might help, but I am not sure if I could because I have to collect data.
Wednesday, October 7, 2015 at 10:06am PDT
Hi everyone! I learned this morning that a representative from StopWaste is coming tomorrow to check out our recycling system. Would anyone like to be our ambassador and show how the system works? Ideally, if you're going to be ambassador, you'd have someone in mind to take over your job for tomorrow.
Friday, October 2, 2015 at 6:36pm PDT
 
Friday, October 2, 2015 at 6:08pm PDT
We'll explain over the weekend, so don't worry if you weren't there today :)
Friday, October 2, 2015 at 5:16pm PDT
This is not my idea, though.
Friday, October 2, 2015 at 5:10pm PDT
New arrangement for sort.

Friday, October 2, 2015 at 4:33pm PDT
Hi Aakash - this is Kathryn on Adrian's phone.
Friday, October 2, 2015 at 12:01pm PDT
Aye Denise apparently Wheaton told Hammerson that I'm not in recycling roster or something
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:49pm PDT
I can't be there either because of my college writing class
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:48pm PDT
Good luck!
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:48pm PDT
my mom wants me to come straight home so I can rest before the sat lol
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:47pm PDT
I can't be there
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:47pm PDT
I will definitely come. B)
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:47pm PDT
oh, yes, i'm going as well
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:47pm PDT
 
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:45pm PDT
I can be there until 3:30 because I have a game tomorrow
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:37pm PDT
Alright then.
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:37pm PDT
Wait so who will NOT be there tmrw?
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:37pm PDT
@samast YES, I will offer some tips on leadership tmrw 󾌵 that was another thing j noticed
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:37pm PDT
Collect officers tend to have a lot on their plate already as controlling the kids is difficult. Adrian I recommend you simply stand by the dumpsters and have the bin lifters help call out data for you
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:36pm PDT
I mean how much, cause some of the officers did tell me about that info.
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:35pm PDT
I think collect officers should check them and then tell me when the group reaches the dumpster area?
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:34pm PDT
By the way, is there a more efficient way to collect data for the bins. All I did is stop the collect team to check for how much stuff.
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:33pm PDT
So true. We should be more responsible.
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:32pm PDT
officers should take more control of their team and not let them leave freely
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:31pm PDT
Just anything you noticed that could be improved, problems, or things that are good as well, any ideas etc
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:31pm PDT
 
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:31pm PDT
becayse I MIGHT be able to make it, but not 100% sure
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:31pm PDT
idk what to comment then
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:31pm PDT
How about all of us go, if possible?
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:31pm PDT
Yeeeeeeaaaaaaah
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:31pm PDT
loool
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:30pm PDT
I'm not very sure, she was not very specific
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:30pm PDT
Yeah but she also wants to address other stuff regarding officers in general
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:30pm PDT
I don't actually know, but I would imagine an hour or less
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:30pm PDT
ohhh well how would you know if you haven't suopervised sort yet
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:29pm PDT
how long will the meeting be?
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:29pm PDT
Basically, the sort team that crushes the bottles, by the recycle shed
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:29pm PDT
what exactyl do u mean by recycling at sort area
Thursday, October 1, 2015 at 8:27pm PDT
Just a reminder to please give me your feedback about recycling if you will NOT be able to attend the meeting afterschool tmrw in wheaton's room
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 10:00pm PDT
np :)
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 10:00pm PDT
thanks ^_^
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 10:00pm PDT
i already made a new one just in case <3
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:58pm PDT
fyi no one can find the rotunda sign
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:49pm PDT
Okay then.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:49pm PDT
nope, adrian, you stay by the dumpsters and collect data :D
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:48pm PDT
Do I have to do it?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:48pm PDT
YES to wat kathryn said, good idea!
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:48pm PDT
ALSO SORT CAPTAINS and officers who do sort, let us know if you ever need more supplies like bags and gloves :D
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:47pm PDT
Maybe if you guys are in charge of pulling bottles out of the bags?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:47pm PDT
i believe in you <3
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:46pm PDT
hopefully we will find that many...
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:46pm PDT
Alright! :)
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:45pm PDT
YES PLEASE <3 we need 80-100
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:45pm PDT
Me and Lily will be collecting bottles right!
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:45pm PDT
and someone will go investigate ahaha
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:45pm PDT
and if there are randomly stray bins that you see out about in school when its NOT recycling, please just like mention in this chat
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:44pm PDT
pick up EVERYTHING that's put out there
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:44pm PDT
OH BTW in case you didnt kno: always pick up cardboard boxes from rooms
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:43pm PDT
and i updated our sign in sheets to accomodate more ppl!
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 9:42pm PDT
LOOOOOOOOL i made that fb post without seeing this chat BUT basically, everything you guys are saying, i agree
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:52pm PDT
(y)
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:52pm PDT
Does anyone feel that they need more recyclers with them or an extra officer to help at their wing?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:51pm PDT
Okay so one of you want to take the library, the other faculty commons & rotunda?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:50pm PDT
I was 700 wing
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:50pm PDT
me and bhavya
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:49pm PDT
󾌵 okay so 2 subgroups for rotunda, each led by a different officer. Who was in charge of the rotunda/library last week?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:48pm PDT
yeah for sure
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:47pm PDT
;)
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:47pm PDT
Just make sure they don't make a racket
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:47pm PDT
cool
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:47pm PDT
Sure
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:47pm PDT
I can take 8-10 people for a wing right?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:47pm PDT
Ideally, unless you want to change.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:46pm PDT
i assume we are sticking with the assignments we got last week?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:46pm PDT
 
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:46pm PDT
ok so rotunda with 2 sub groups
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:45pm PDT
Maybe bring 12-ish recyclers then, immediately after we separate at the beginning of read?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:45pm PDT
Good idea.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:45pm PDT
would it be possible to split up the rotunda group so one group does the actual rotunda and the other does the front office, faculty commons, and the library?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:44pm PDT
Yeah lol if no one is doing library I can help out to but preferably before the bell . I was like 10 mins late last week cuz library bins were unattended
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:43pm PDT
hm.....
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:43pm PDT
At least, I'm guessing. We can ask Mrs. DiFranco tomorrow.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:42pm PDT
how many bins are there in the library? 4?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:42pm PDT
He is just fooling around, Samast.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:41pm PDT
wait aakash what LOL
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:40pm PDT
Fine.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:40pm PDT
 
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:39pm PDT
Just send them to sort
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:39pm PDT
I think you are right because my proposed plan is to remove those kinds of people as soon as we spot them. Sounds harsh?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:38pm PDT
Maybe throw some gasoline in there too.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:37pm PDT
I'd suggest giving them a couple bananas as well.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:37pm PDT
If you find people wasting time, politely ask them to go help sort.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:37pm PDT
What shall we do if we find other people not doing anything at all? Shall we do something about it?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:30pm PDT
Other questions or concerns? Deep philosophical ruminations?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:29pm PDT
Got it
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:29pm PDT
Sure, if Sort is running smoothly then feel free to go help at the library 󾌵
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:28pm PDT
Yes, my bad
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:28pm PDT
At Sort, you mean?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:28pm PDT
 
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:27pm PDT
Should I help with the library tomorrow? At collect I feel there are more than enough people and officers
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:27pm PDT
 
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:27pm PDT
We'll have ~30 new people coming tomorrow so they'll probably have questions. Feel free to answer them yourselves or refer them to me or Denise.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:25pm PDT
Remember, if you're a collect officer, to sign in the people you have with you :)
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:25pm PDT
True.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:24pm PDT
Tomorrow we'll not have to deal with the lengthy explanations that we did last week so things should run faster.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:23pm PDT
An officer can take however many people they deem necessary. We recommend 6-8, but given the number of people we've got right now doing recycling, feel free to take more than 8. For a job as big as the library, maybe 9-12?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:23pm PDT
Any more ideas?
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:22pm PDT
Maybe more if needed.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:21pm PDT
How large is the group supposed to be. I think it should be about 9-10.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:21pm PDT
okie dokie (y)
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:21pm PDT
Feel free to grab as many people as you need
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:21pm PDT
because we couldn't get all of the rotunda + gateway + library
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:21pm PDT
we dumped out the second bin only after read was over
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:20pm PDT
But I am not too sure what to do with people not doing anything.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:20pm PDT
I was one of the officers for library and we didn't have enough people
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:20pm PDT
I think we should watch each group carefully to ensure that each person is doing something as well as not leave things behind like you mentioned.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:20pm PDT
 
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:18pm PDT
Also we need to speak with team leaders about doing there jobs. Libraries second bin was neglected. Bins were taken and never brought back to room of origination including science prep room. It is their job to make sure everything is picked up and returned.
Wednesday, September 30, 2015 at 8:18pm PDT
What exactly?

Saturday, February 6, 2016 at 6:12pm PST
Um we can totally prep together if you want. We should at least prep together one day so we know each other's strength and weaknesses and stuff?
Saturday, February 6, 2016 at 6:11pm PST
Idk
Saturday, February 6, 2016 at 6:11pm PST
Or was it vertical asymptote
Saturday, February 6, 2016 at 6:11pm PST
Horizontal asymptote because can't touch us

Saturday, February 6, 2016 at 6:06pm PST
yay :D
Saturday, February 6, 2016 at 6:06pm PST

Okays I'll do it now
Saturday, February 6, 2016 at 6:05pm PST

ok, that's good. so i'll be doing physics and i guess part of bio? and you guys will take the rest? i feel like i'm going for forget all of chem lol
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:04pm PST
so we have two books to study from
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:04pm PST
okay i can ask too
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:04pm PST
or if you want you can ask too
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:03pm PST
:) i'll ask her tmrw. and if i see you i'll give you the book. are you the bio person or is jessica?
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:02pm PST
i think she'll say yes since its for the tournament haha
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:02pm PST
yah i think thats a great idea
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:02pm PST
zoe, do you think we should ask wheaton just to temporarily borrow a bio book? idk if she'll agree, but i guess it's for a noble cause haha
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:00pm PST
yeah true
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:00pm PST
it doesn't make sense to expect ppl to know ap bc some take it in senior year
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:00pm PST
I think bio will be non-ap though
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:00pm PST
Hmm, I'm thinking they'll keep it mostly basic bc there will be sophomores there who haven't taken ap, but I'm going study ap physics 2 just in case
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 5:59pm PST
are the questions like general stuff or like ap lol
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 5:59pm PST
I'm hoping to somehow get my hands on some kind of biology book so i can study a bit
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 5:58pm PST
if you want, i'll try my best to help with that as well
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 5:58pm PST
:) so we're all in chem, so i guess that subject will be fine, but how are you planning on doing bio?
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 5:57pm PST
yaaaaaas!!!!!!
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 5:57pm PST
I'm so late but if you guys haven't found someone else, I'm in! :) At least I'll be forcing myself to prep early for the AP Physics exam lol.

ill ask victoria
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:15pm PST
haha
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:15pm PST
if there are also bio/physics we can do a collab?
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:15pm PST
and we can have teams of 2 to 3 ppl
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:15pm PST
and tell their friends
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:15pm PST
there is nothing else I can think of

and ask people to signup
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:15pm PST

Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:09pm PST
for science bowl
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:09pm PST
I already made a lot of chem questions
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 5:09pm PST

Tuesday, December 15, 2015 at 7:40pm PST
Wellington, can you ask mrs.liu whether we can have a meeting either tomorrow or thursday during lunch
Sunday, December 13, 2015 at 12:58pm PST
i think officer meetings also count as meetings

Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:36pm PST
What would be the purpose of this
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:32pm PST
Stuff with fireproof paper and balloons using other materials.
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:31pm PST
Should we do thermodynamic stuff since we're doing that in chem?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:29pm PST

I've heard colloids from somewhere so maybe.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:56pm PST
Cover it just in case.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:56pm PST
Wait. Maybe.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:56pm PST
wth kk
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:56pm PST
no
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:54pm PST
and colloids as well right
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:53pm PST
Oh. I think we did cover that.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:53pm PST
raoult's law is related to the vapor pressure of a solvent
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:52pm PST
colligative properties are properties of a solution that depend on solute concentration
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:51pm PST
Lol I really need to study.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:51pm PST
Yo, what are coligative props and raoult's law again?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:51pm PST
and did you cover raoult's law?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:51pm PST
do you guys have calculations with coliigative properties or just conceptually
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:42pm PST
or just pull frqs from online
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:41pm PST
I think I'll just make some multiple choice questions instead
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:41pm PST
I am going to start now
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 11:31pm PST
Did anyone make any questions yet?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:47pm PST

Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:46pm PST
I'll be back in an hour or so
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:44pm PST
So simple calculation of energy released or absorbed to heat something up to x degrees.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:43pm PST
We havve some stuff with phase changes as well.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:43pm PST
Oh yeah.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:42pm PST
Are there any math relates questions possible
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:41pm PST
And there are several trends we could go over.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:40pm PST
That's it
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:40pm PST
yea
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:40pm PST
So larger ldf
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:40pm PST
It means something is larger
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:40pm PST
That too.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:39pm PST
and she's obsessed w the word polarizability so something w that
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:39pm PST
IMFs
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:39pm PST
For this coming Chem test
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:39pm PST
And that will be what we are doing
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:39pm PST
yeah
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:38pm PST
And post it in the group
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:38pm PST
Alrite so we are going to make a practice frq
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:33pm PST
Apurva what do you want me to do
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:33pm PST
I cant do after school at all

Know about it
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:32pm PST
No one's gonna
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:32pm PST
I emailed her nevermind because if we don't post tonight
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:26pm PST
Ohk
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:25pm PST
prolly an frq that spans multiple topics
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:25pm PST
Remember she said that we should probably review all the previous chapters too though
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:24pm PST
Omfg thank god
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:01pm PST
Yeah. It's just IMFs. xD
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:01pm PST
yes
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:01pm PST
Is that why there was so much confusion? Lol
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:00pm PST
oh then yay
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 9:00pm PST
Nope it's just 11 and 13 on school loop

oh, I thought it was on everything covered till now
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:40pm PST
Intermolecular forces in states of matter, types of IMFs, strengths of those IMFs, viscosity, surface tension, phase changes, phase change diagrams, vapor pressure, solution process/forces, types of IMFs in solutions, saturated solutions and solubility, factors affecting solubility (polarity polarizability etc), solution concentration calculations, and colligative properties
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:38pm PST
K one sec
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:37pm PST
yeah sure
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:37pm PST
Do you need the whole topic list for this next ap chem test
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:37pm PST
anything else?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:36pm PST
stoichiometry solutions atomic structure and quantum chemistry periodic trends chemical bonding molecular geometry and bonding theories gases IMF
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:35pm PST
?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:21pm PST
can someone just list the chemistry topics covered on the test since not all of us have the chem textbooks
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:04pm PST
darn
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:04pm PST
I cant do after sool
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:04pm PST
wait is this actually happening though
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:04pm PST
and probably ask liu to tell the classes for us
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:03pm PST
^^^Go
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:03pm PST
we'd have to publicize now though
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:03pm PST
rishi?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:03pm PST
I have deca but could come for most of it
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:03pm PST
More time.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:03pm PST
I'd actually prefer to have it after school.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:03pm PST
idk how much help i'll be though
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:03pm PST
i should be
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:03pm PST
How many of you guys are available after school?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:02pm PST
Well not everybody, but some of us.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:01pm PST
That should have us ready.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:01pm PST
Yeah
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 8:00pm PST
have some frqs maybe
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:59pm PST
...
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:59pm PST
we'll ask you questions then
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:59pm PST
what if no one asks any questions
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:59pm PST
lol
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:59pm PST
specific questions that people didn't ask in class maybe?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:59pm PST
I need to know how we are structuring this
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:58pm PST
what do you mean by extra clarifications?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:57pm PST
yeah prob
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:57pm PST
probably just extra clarification tomorrow?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:57pm PST
oh
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:57pm PST
Liu's doing a short question time in class
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:56pm PST
but then liu will prolly review that in class
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:56pm PST
can you ask Liu what's on the test and go over that stuff vaguely 󾌱󾌴
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:56pm PST
so no tutoring for tomorrow?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:55pm PST
i think people would be a lot more serious about their finals though
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:55pm PST
we can all create a few questions
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:54pm PST
pls
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:54pm PST
"we" as in apurva
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:54pm PST
and then discuss them later
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:54pm PST
so that if no one asks questions, we can give them practice questions to solve
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:54pm PST
we could create a practice frq or mcqs
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:45pm PST
we don't even know if we will be able to tutor tomorrow
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:44pm PST
I need to go over everything too.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:44pm PST
Alright.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:44pm PST
It'll be tough to teach it though
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:44pm PST
I mean I'll be fine as long as it is a question
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:44pm PST
oops gave my notes to liu so i'll just have to do my best to remember
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:44pm PST

ohhh
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:43pm PST
boiling point, meltng point
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:43pm PST
properties as in cleavage?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:43pm PST
oh that stufff
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:43pm PST
As well as how they compare to each other.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:43pm PST
And how they pertain to several different properties.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:42pm PST
is it just london dispersion, ionic, dipole-ionic, dipole-dipole and stuff?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:41pm PST
like for intermolecular forces
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:40pm PST
for some chapters
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:40pm PST
I don't remember what the depth for ap chem was though
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:40pm PST
Lol i dont rmemeber any of it
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:39pm PST
I am kinda rusty with this stuff
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:39pm PST
do you even need to
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:39pm PST

Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:38pm PST
I don't want to review
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:38pm PST

Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:36pm PST
Wellington, if we get the confrimation, is the meeting after school or during lunch?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:35pm PST
I'd prefer something like where students ask questions and we can answer
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:35pm PST
I am not current enough with the subject material to crash course it
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:33pm PST
That, and assuming half of everybody didn't study much over break, it would work best that way.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:32pm PST
And by a lot, I mean A LOT.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:31pm PST
I think crash course it since there's just a lot of stuff to remember.
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 7:30pm PST
If we are tutoring, how are we going to structure it?
Sunday, November 29, 2015 at 12:00am PST

meet at beginning of lunch?
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 9:16pm PST
Yes that would be a good idea. So Lily and I might go over it otherwise lunch tom. for sure
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 9:15pm PST
you and lily can but i can't because my mom needs my computer later and she gets like super mad when i use it past lik 9:30ish lol parents but dont worry about me i've got what im going to say on lock if you want though we can meet in the library at lunch and go through it real quick
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 9:07pm PST
Hey is Lily there? Cause I'm not sure whether to wait or not because aren't we also going to do a mini presentation through hangouts?
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 8:58pm PST
Yeah that's ok. Ill shorten it down after
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 8:57pm PST
okay I formatted it anyway lol
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 8:57pm PST
Sorry I just saw this. I was waiting for Lily to finish her part because she said she would help me with the warrant after so I just left my info up there so she could refer to it before I shorten it down
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 8:30pm PST
hey chrish are you finished? Would it be okay if i formatted the slide and added pictures?
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 7:48pm PST
 
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 7:48pm PST
 
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 6:47pm PST
do whatever makes you comfortable and easy for you to talk about
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 6:46pm PST
ya thats good info but maybe we can do what i did and basically just say those things but separate the movies and arguments into different slides
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 6:44pm PST
Ok so I put up my part. But I will make it look nicer later. Would you mind checking to see if makes sense and possible help me with the the warrent
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 6:41pm PST
oh ok yeah then it should be fine
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 6:41pm PST
i dont think so, i talked to julie and she said everyone brought up notecards
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 6:40pm PST
Yeah im going to do the same because otherwise I know Ill screw up. Hopefully she wont take off points
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 6:39pm PST
im definitely bringing note cards though
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 6:38pm PST
ok we can make it look nice too, i was told from fifth period smith, the less words the better so more visual and more talking instead of all the info on the slides
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 6:37pm PST
I was hoping to finish by 7:30 to 8. I was about to put up the info that I wanted to present and I was hoping you guys could look over to see if it makes sense and help me put it on differnt slides
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 6:35pm PST
*nine
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 6:35pm PST
hey guys I want to be done before mine so we have time to practice what we're saying so can we please finish then, I'm almost done with my slides
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 5:23pm PST
oh ok yeah i think we should be able to chat there now
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 5:23pm PST
just click the little chat button and it will log you in
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 5:22pm PST
ok ok yeah you show as anon and I think I do to so I wasn't sure who was online. Is it lily or you? I am logged in but I don't know why it still makes my edits as anon
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 5:21pm PST
hey chrish could you sign on so we can talk on the chat
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 5:06pm PST
im on now
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 3:41pm PST
Yeah that's what I was going to ask later. Yes I think it would be a good idea to dress up and I know it is raining tomorrow but I was going to wear a pencil skirt with a blazer
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 3:40pm PST
okay thanks and do you guys wanna dress up? I think we should a lot of people in smiths class dressed up
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 3:40pm PST
Yeah I started adding stuff and I ll see what I else to add
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 3:39pm PST
well you can start adding stuff now if you're home and you want to I'm just not home yet
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 3:38pm PST
I added a bit because I wasn't sure of what to do since everyone got off the slides. But thats ok. Then we can start in an hour and hopefully Lily can be on at that time as well
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 3:37pm PST
like I'll be on the computer in an hour to finish it
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 3:37pm PST
I started slides yesterday I'll be able to finish them in an hour
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 3:36pm PST
That's ok. But we need to finish today so could we all get started in it as soon as possible?
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 3:24pm PST
hey sorry I just now saw this
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 12:24pm PST
Hey did you guys want to meet in the library to finish our presentation?
Tuesday, March 8, 2016 at 7:27pm PST
Yeah so I think we could use that as one of the examples
Tuesday, March 8, 2016 at 7:17pm PST
I agree I've read the first one and a little of the second and it seems as if the movies leave out a lot of major detail
Tuesday, March 8, 2016 at 7:16pm PST
Hey! So Lily and I talked about possible options for some ideas for the project on the google doc. But another idea or books being better that I had was Harry Potter like big time because the movies for the series suck since so many key parts are left out. And no I am not a big fan of Harry Potter so I don't remember the series too well but I do remember doing several projects for the series in elementary school and watching the movies afterwards which I didn't really think were the best
Tuesday, March 8, 2016 at 6:30pm PST
oops sorry i though i was logged on
Tuesday, March 8, 2016 at 6:30pm PST
ya sounds good
Tuesday, March 8, 2016 at 6:30pm PST
Also, when you guys are working on the project, would you mind logging in so we can take advantage of the chat function while we work?
Tuesday, March 8, 2016 at 6:29pm PST
Yes, I think these choices are good. We could add "A Wrinkle in Time" if possible?
Tuesday, March 8, 2016 at 6:16pm PST
hey guys so I've found a few ideas of good books turned into bad movies and just wanted to make sure you guys were good with the picks, the Leonardo dicaprio version of Romeo and Juliet (Leo may be adorable but the movie was a tragedy), how the grinch stole Christmas (the creepy one with Jim carry) maybe need some help thinking of some more

Many science club officers have already been there before. However, this camp is purely for fun for you three, because it does not really benefit your respective officer positions. However, it is still an awesome trip and opportunity!
Saturday, April 4, 2015 at 11:58pm PDT
Hi everyone! I just wanted to invite you all to LEAF 2015! It will be an overnight, weekend trip on May 30th and 31st. You would leave Saturday morning and come back Sunday afternoon. It is at a place called Camp Arroyo and it's in Livermore. It is free (GARIMA plz double check on that) and Its basically a camp where you meet lots of middle school and high school aged kids who are involved with eco-friendly projects and you get to participate and learn about various companies and individuals who are dedicated to helping planet earth.

Yeah! lol
Sunday, March 20, 2016 at 10:31pm PDT
(i hope thats right, bc im looking over the assignment again on schoolloop and its kind of confusing ha)
Sunday, March 20, 2016 at 10:20pm PDT
Okay thanks
Sunday, March 20, 2016 at 10:12pm PDT
and the ones that have multiple parts, do ace
Sunday, March 20, 2016 at 10:12pm PDT
do all the problems
Sunday, March 20, 2016 at 10:12pm PDT
basically
Sunday, March 20, 2016 at 10:12pm PDT
um yes?
Sunday, March 20, 2016 at 10:09pm PDT
Or do all problem except for ace?
Sunday, March 20, 2016 at 10:09pm PDT
So just do ace for all?
Sunday, March 20, 2016 at 10:08pm PDT
??
Sunday, March 20, 2016 at 10:08pm PDT
all questions, but aces?

oh okay haha
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 11:26pm PDT
The one with too much Naoh
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 11:26pm PDT
I just kinda ignored the 2nd trial lol
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 11:26pm PDT
 
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 11:26pm PDT
oh well did u put 75? i'll just use that
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 11:25pm PDT
Maybe lol
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 11:25pm PDT
sorry im getting confised
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 11:25pm PDT
or maybe it was 50 mL to dilute the acid for second trial
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:45pm PDT
:P
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:45pm PDT
HAHAHAH

oh haha
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:38pm PDT
They got 35% error though heh
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:38pm PDT
Ayeeee fam sauravs group is also group 2 and they got KHSO4
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:38pm PDT
 
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:37pm PDT
I think LOL
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:36pm PDT
that seems reasonable right
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:36pm PDT
oh okay
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:36pm PDT
Ok so the closest one I would say is kPa of 2 which is KHSO4
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:35pm PDT
I'm so stupid
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:35pm PDT
Oh wait that's right lmao
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:35pm PDT
idk if we were supposed to but
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:34pm PDT
when we were doing it as a group we just assumed pH = pKa and didnt do any other calculation lol
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:34pm PDT
altho idk maybe we were just rlly off
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:34pm PDT
what do you mean?
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:34pm PDT
but the thing is im not sure we need to do the kPa thing
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:32pm PDT
And if I use the halfway point between the point I marked Ka2 and I did 10^- the pH of that halfway point and it doesn't match any of the kpas lol
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:31pm PDT
But isn't that what she told us
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:31pm PDT
Cuz the graph on the pre lab thingy looks different
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:31pm PDT
That's what I thought but I'm not sure
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:31pm PDT
?*
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:31pm PDT
where u labeled pKa2>
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:30pm PDT
so where is the equivalence point exactly
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:30pm PDT
 
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:18pm PDT
nah its cool
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:17pm PDT
sorry for the confusion
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:17pm PDT
just identity LOL
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:17pm PDT
i think you're right
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:16pm PDT
lmao ok
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:15pm PDT
Let me double check
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:15pm PDT
I wrote that for objective also but I may have been hallucinating
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:15pm PDT
alright
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:15pm PDT
lmao haha
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:15pm PDT
IDK LOL
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:15pm PDT
uh
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:15pm PDT
oh. wait we need concentration?
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:15pm PDT
right
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:14pm PDT
but i think she said she wanted us to change the x axis from time to volume?
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:14pm PDT
oh but for concentration
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:14pm PDT
for that no
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:14pm PDT
but the thing is if we just need the pH from the graph bc pH = kPa we don't need the volume right
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:13pm PDT
SAME LOL
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:13pm PDT
np. hopefully all that info is correct haha
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:10pm PDT
Thanks 󾌵
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:10pm PDT
ok cool
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:10pm PDT
yea pretty sure?
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:09pm PDT
Lol
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:09pm PDT
Right
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:09pm PDT
Is the one lily has under 1st trial
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:09pm PDT
lmao
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:09pm PDT
(y)
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:09pm PDT
The trial that we actuall did correct
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:09pm PDT
okay
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:09pm PDT
yah
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:09pm PDT
wait really
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:05pm PDT
cuz we didn't refill Naoh in he last trial
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:05pm PDT
I think it might be 50
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 10:05pm PDT
Wait
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 9:58pm PDT
but idk waht the total was for the second trial
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 9:58pm PDT
for the first trial u can prob subtract to find naOh used
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 9:58pm PDT
um
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 9:57pm PDT
Or does that matter
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 9:57pm PDT
Does anyone know how much Naoh we used for the trials?? Lol
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 9:57pm PDT
Oh ok
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 9:57pm PDT
2nd*
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 9:56pm PDT
75 i think? for 3nd trial
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 9:56pm PDT
So for 2nd trial around 100 ml was used to dilute the acid and for second trial we used 50?
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 7:46pm PDT
does someone have the rest/more data or is that it?
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 7:44pm PDT
thank you!! <3
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 3:56pm PDT
thanks lily 󾌵
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 3:51pm PDT
so apparently you guys needed data from me and this is all I have. 1st trial means the 1st trial and 2nd trial accidentally got flipped so "2nd trial" on my sheet would be referring to the one that we thought was polyprotic while "1st trial" would actually be the 3rd trial. Sorry for the delay!
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 3:49pm PDT
 
Wednesday, March 16, 2016 at 6:44am PDT
Lolol thanks
Wednesday, March 16, 2016 at 1:21am PDT

Wednesday, March 16, 2016 at 12:41am PDT
Then what happens afterwards
Wednesday, March 16, 2016 at 12:41am PDT
Oh okay thanks
Wednesday, March 16, 2016 at 12:35am PDT
Standardize the Naoh and then set up titration for Naoh with the unknown except instead of going drop by drop we're just letting the thing have a steady continuous drip while the ph meter is in it
Wednesday, March 16, 2016 at 12:24am PDT
What's our procedure?
Wednesday, March 16, 2016 at 12:17am PDT
sure
Wednesday, March 16, 2016 at 12:17am PDT
Wanna discuss lab in a sec?
Wednesday, March 16, 2016 at 12:17am PDT
i am
Wednesday, March 16, 2016 at 12:06am PDT
Is anyone still up?
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:36pm PDT
ikr haha too late
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:33pm PDT
Which means if someone had done it last semester it could've saved us lmao
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:33pm PDT
Maybe finally someone had the courage to speak up LOL
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:33pm PDT
cuz we've had like multiple big assignments due together in the past
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:33pm PDT
So I'm hoping it's changed but I'm scared
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:33pm PDT
Fuck I don't wanna write that on my birthday..
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:33pm PDT
Honestly idk but I'm scared

darn what are they going to do
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:32pm PDT
ikr lol
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:32pm PDT
Is it just me that's suspicious why the English teachers extended the due date for the argument lol
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:31pm PDT
Ahhh okay I'll brb
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:29pm PDT
and we graphy it or something with SPARK
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:29pm PDT
we're going to titrate the weak acid and have the pH meter in there
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:28pm PDT
So what's the second part?
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:27pm PDT
yesh
Tuesday, March 15, 2016 at 10:24pm PDT
So for the lab the standardizing part is the same as last lab?
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 8:32pm PST
haha mine went down :P
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 5:29pm PST
That's so weird. Lol

Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:33am PST
What's the equation of acetic acid?
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:33am PST
yeah np
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:33am PST
so 1.085 M is HCH3COO and the other two are 0
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:33am PST
Thanks
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:33am PST
Ouuu okay!
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:32am PST
i averaged the concentrations for acetic acid
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:32am PST
Okay thanks
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:32am PST
Can I see? Just the initial values
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:31am PST
use the Ka value lily wrote lol

Oh ahaha nvm I got how lily did it. But what moles of Noah and concentration acid did u get cuz mine is different from lily
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:20am PST
i used m1v1 = m2v2
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:16am PST
Wait wats the eaquation for the base to acid concentration?
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:13am PST
mhm
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:12am PST
Oh wait nvm
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:12am PST

Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:12am PST
And and the volume we use is still 100ml?
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:12am PST
So the data table we just plug in the same molarity as last time?
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:12am PST
 
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:12am PST
Oh!! Okay
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:11am PST
but now using base to find acid
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:10am PST
same principle as part 1
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:10am PST
so using the concentration u found for NaOH, use that to find the unknown acid concentration
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:10am PST
so the reason u standardize it is to find the concentration of NaOH
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:09am PST
???? Sorry ahaha I'm half asleep so it takes twice as much effort to understand
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:09am PST
i took the concentration of NaOH from part 1 and used it in M1V1 equation for part 2
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:08am PST
Okay I need help wih part 2
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:08am PST
okay yeah so this is part 1
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:07am PST
That's part 2
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:07am PST
No. Part 1 is standard part 2 is na oh molarity and moles of Noah for acid
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:07am PST
also looking at the picture u sent me this is actually part 1?
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:06am PST
if part 2 is the standardization part, then yes
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:06am PST
That's for part 2 right?
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:06am PST
Okay
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:05am PST
to get molarity
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:05am PST
divided by 100 mL
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:05am PST
How did u get 0.047
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:03am PST
 
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:03am PST
And then find concentration of the acid and ph
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:02am PST
 
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:02am PST
yeah hold on
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:02am PST
wait whats part 2
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:02am PST
Do u have example?
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:02am PST
is used M1V1 = M2V2
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:02am PST
Part 2
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:01am PST
anyways
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:01am PST
wait u need moles of NaOH>
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:00am PST
Oh okay how do u mind oh molarity and moles of Noah?
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:00am PST
oh ha
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:00am PST
she put an asterick next to it tho so idk what that means
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:00am PST
Oh okay.. I just used that equation but put lily mol. 󾌴󾌴󾌴
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:00am PST
yeah
Friday, March 11, 2016 at 12:00am PST
Yeah!! Did u get 0.0047
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 11:59pm PST
same i got different mol of KHP from her
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 11:59pm PST
Or how lily got them
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 11:59pm PST
Ahaha I don't get calculations
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 11:59pm PST
ofc
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 11:58pm PST
Are u still up?
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 11:58pm PST
Hey Jessica?
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 10:32pm PST
Okay thanks!
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 10:32pm PST
i think so
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 10:27pm PST
No post lab question or analysis right?
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 10:27pm PST
So we just need calculations and conclusion?
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 10:27pm PST
thanks Lilyy

I'm here. Sorry for the delay. Give me a few moments.
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 10:16pm PST
So I'm guessing we're just not going to include the third data?
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 7:21pm PST
Ahah hopefully but thanks.
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 7:19pm PST
For now I guess just do calculations for what you have
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 7:19pm PST
Maybe she'll come back later? :/
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 6:43pm PST
Oh no what are we gonna do??
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 6:33pm PST
Nope
Thursday, March 10, 2016 at 6:24pm PST
Wait did anyone get the third trial?
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 8:28pm PST
Hey lily? Can U send the data for the third trial?
Tuesday, March 8, 2016 at 11:24pm PST
yw?

Saturday, March 5, 2016 at 5:22pm PST
Haha funny
Saturday, March 5, 2016 at 5:21pm PST
HAHA TRUE
Saturday, March 5, 2016 at 5:21pm PST

:P
Friday, March 4, 2016 at 9:21pm PST
Ahah same but thanks
Friday, March 4, 2016 at 9:03pm PST
Sorry meant 2(sin^2)x
Friday, March 4, 2016 at 9:03pm PST
I tried and failed. Ended up with 2sin^x = 2
Friday, March 4, 2016 at 5:49pm PST
Oh ahaha
Friday, March 4, 2016 at 5:49pm PST
oh sorry I was looking at number 5 lol my bad
Friday, March 4, 2016 at 5:49pm PST
 
Friday, March 4, 2016 at 5:49pm PST
And then?
Friday, March 4, 2016 at 5:48pm PST
Yah do that and then multiply. It'll be easier
Friday, March 4, 2016 at 5:47pm PST
So completely change them into sin and cos?
Friday, March 4, 2016 at 5:47pm PST
Try multiplying by the denominator of the left side and see where that gets you
Friday, March 4, 2016 at 5:45pm PST
Wait #3
Friday, March 4, 2016 at 5:44pm PST
Oh thanks ahaha
Friday, March 4, 2016 at 5:44pm PST

Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 10:25pm PST
also does anyone have observations for intro B?
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:59pm PST
wowow so cool
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:57pm PST
Ahaah we should do this
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:56pm PST
so idk
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:56pm PST
and even though technically it was supposed to start out blue then turn that milky opaque pink, technically it started out as the light pink thing and then became opaque
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:55pm PST
i added AgNO3
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:55pm PST
before i put it in teh hot water
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:55pm PST
oh also
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:55pm PST
it was initially this opaque pale pink
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:54pm PST
but i wrote "hot water bath --> strong blue"
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:54pm PST
only did the hot one and not the cold one
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:54pm PST
thanks
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:53pm PST
And what about the temperature part on activity c
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:53pm PST
Send ur part?
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 7:53pm PST
 
Tuesday, February 9, 2016 at 10:28pm PST
Okayy
Tuesday, February 9, 2016 at 10:26pm PST
im going to copy some of it and just print out hte rest
Tuesday, February 9, 2016 at 10:26pm PST
Guys do we have to copy data table in lab notebook?
Tuesday, February 9, 2016 at 5:01pm PST
AHAH thanks lily!!!
Tuesday, February 9, 2016 at 4:51pm PST
Ok, it looks like i was being alarmist. Sorry guys! :)
Tuesday, February 9, 2016 at 4:37pm PST
Hey guys, can you check the graphs and calculations on the spreadsheet when you can? I feel like something's wrong bc our final graph isn't linear, but I probably made a mistake...
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 11:19pm PST
oh thank goodness
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 11:18pm PST
no we dont have to do B
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 11:17pm PST
did you guys to part B of the guided inquiry
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 11:16pm PST
yes
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 11:14pm PST
Concentration increased the chance of collision right?
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:54pm PST
np
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:50pm PST
Crap okay thanks
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:50pm PST
yah
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:48pm PST
Kk do I need to know their4th period?
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:48pm PST
yup
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:47pm PST
Kk $1 each?
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:47pm PST
you can get them from me tomorrow in chem
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:46pm PST
Crap I forgot to buy chinese grams
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:46pm PST
When the best range is like 0.2 to 1 or something I think
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:46pm PST
Okay thanks
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:46pm PST
our wavelength was at absorbance greater than 1
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:45pm PST
Do u know what sources of error are?
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:45pm PST
Okay I think I'm done with calc
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:32pm PST
Mhm
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:32pm PST
thanks
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:32pm PST
oh ok lol
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:32pm PST
 
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:31pm PST
why is that the slope
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:31pm PST
K=-slope
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:31pm PST
-slope
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:30pm PST
Oh AHAHA sorry read UR question wrong
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:30pm PST
how do we do that?
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:29pm PST
Yeah
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:29pm PST
Kk
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:29pm PST
how can we find k' from the right linear graph
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:28pm PST
i kinda get it but not 100%
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:28pm PST
AHAHA do u get it now? Or nahh
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:27pm PST
can you explain lol
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:27pm PST
since you get what lily said in the google chat
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:20pm PST
Okay I thought that was U lol
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:19pm PST
yeah i was confused about what you were talking about until i opened it and saw that she edited it lol
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:19pm PST
Oh!!! AHAHA okay
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:19pm PST
Lol but U got the value for the graph
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:19pm PST
lily did it
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:18pm PST
i didn't do that yet
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:18pm PST
Like what value of cv did u use
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:18pm PST
The ln(cv)
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:18pm PST
what calculations?
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:18pm PST
Zoe wait how did u find those calculations?
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:15pm PST
um
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:12pm PST
But UR step Jessica is basically just make the graph right?
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:12pm PST
Okay and under experiment overview is says find rate law
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:00pm PST
go to background, look around Equation 3
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 10:00pm PST
What is the pseudo rate stuff
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:59pm PST
okay under "analyze the results" it says "calculate values of lnCV and 1/CV and preform graphical analysis descirbed in question 3 to determine the order of reaction and then value of the pseudo-rate constant k"
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
Right....??
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
okay cool
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
oh
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
And then that's it
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
So we can use the reaction rate the slope and then we know its first order Becuz the graph of ln is linear and solve for k
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
tbh im v confused what we need to find
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:55pm PST
I meant rate law
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:55pm PST
Okay AHAHA so okay we're trying to find reaction rate
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:54pm PST
um is that the slope? idk
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:54pm PST
Do we have the reaction rate
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:54pm PST
Okay thanks
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:53pm PST
1 mL CV , 6 mL OH
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:52pm PST
I have no clue
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:52pm PST
What was the ratio of cv and oh we used
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:50pm PST
We're finding rate of the reaction
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:47pm PST
Kay aha
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:47pm PST
So yah hahaha
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:47pm PST
I haven't looked at it yet
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:47pm PST
So we're still figuring out what were calculating?
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:46pm PST
Oh AHAHA okay
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:46pm PST
it's the part that we did where we just put the OH and CV in the cuvette
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:46pm PST
Like didn't we have to create procedure
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:45pm PST
what do you mean the procedure part
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:44pm PST
The reaction is first order
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 9:43pm PST
Wait guys what's the procedure part after prepare beer law calibration
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 8:39pm PST
tbh im not sure. i'll read the lab again to try and figure it out
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 8:38pm PST
and then from those we determine reaction order?
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 8:38pm PST
umm idk what we're calculating but we have four or five graphs...
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 7:02pm PST
Oh okay that's good thanks sorry I haven't checked it
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:55pm PST
I don't have the physical paper with me rn sorry
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:55pm PST
I put it on the spreadsheet
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:51pm PST
But can u send data
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 6:51pm PST
I'm not sure I haven't worked on it yet
Thursday, February 4, 2016 at 5:48pm PST
someone please explain what we are doing lol

Tuesday, February 2, 2016 at 10:26pm PST
what exactly are we doing in the lab
Tuesday, February 2, 2016 at 10:26pm PST
so
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 8:32pm PST
haha same
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 8:31pm PST

Monday, February 1, 2016 at 8:30pm PST
whats a bracket
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 8:30pm PST
and the question will be from chem, physics, and bio
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 8:30pm PST
and near the end of FEb or something there will be tournament with brackets and whatnot
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 8:29pm PST
so basically you form team of 1, 2, or 3's
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 8:28pm PST
does anyone know what the stem tournament is?
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:16am PST
yeah hahaha oh well
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:16am PST
yeah there's so much data we prob should have taken down hah :/ but it didnt say to so whatever
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:16am PST
but then idk temperature and pressure
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:16am PST
yea
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:16am PST
did you just use mL?
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:15am PST
you can try it out and see if it works better i guess?
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:15am PST
idk
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:15am PST
but
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:15am PST
right
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:14am PST
but concentration is mol/L
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:14am PST
cuz we all found the rates in mL/s
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:14am PST
wait
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:13am PST
i think
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:13am PST
yeah
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:13am PST
we do?
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:13am PST
don't we have to find the number of moles of CO2
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:13am PST
for the rate law part
Monday, February 1, 2016 at 12:13am PST
i just realized
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:56pm PST
=)
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:55pm PST
AHAHA okay okay
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:55pm PST
lol just fyi i told these to Zoe too so hope we dont all three have the same sources
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:54pm PST
i put surface area, the seal between the stopper and flask not being tight enough, and the syringe being faulty
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:53pm PST
What are sorces of error
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:53pm PST
AHAHA true
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:53pm PST
LOL at least it tastes good?
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:52pm PST
AHAHA omg how come know one got to warn me? 󾌺󾌺󾌺
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:52pm PST
LOL when we were ordering the ladt was like "Large is like that one" and she pointed at your cup HAHA
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:51pm PST
OMG I didn't know the large was THAT large
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:51pm PST
haha it was good. thanks for reminding me to finish my milk tea =P
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:49pm PST
How was milk and honey?
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:49pm PST
haah np?
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:49pm PST
Thanks
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:49pm PST
Okay
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:49pm PST
close enough?
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:48pm PST
but im not sure anymore
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:48pm PST
i just went with .35 bc i did the first one
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:48pm PST
uh
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:44pm PST
K is 0.2
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:44pm PST
But if we try that with 1.2=k(6)
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:44pm PST
So k would be 0.35
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:44pm PST
Cuz I put 0.35=k(1)
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:44pm PST
whats that again
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:44pm PST
uh
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:43pm PST
How bout rate law?
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:43pm PST
yesh
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:43pm PST
Wait our bond order is 1?
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:31pm PST
AHHA Nvm lol ill just make it random
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:03pm PST
different orders?
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:02pm PST
No AHAHA like idk if its right Becuz I used different orders for all of them
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:01pm PST
but good
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:01pm PST
lol it looks funny
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:01pm PST
Wait look I created a new one with point 0,0
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:01pm PST
There's so many different order
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:01pm PST
but google sheets doesnt have a log option
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:00pm PST
Yeah
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:00pm PST
bc theyre not supposed to curve back down
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:00pm PST
but the thing is those lines dont fit the grapg well wnough
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 10:00pm PST
you go to advanced edit
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 9:57pm PST
On the graph?
Sunday, January 31, 2016 at 9:57pm PST
How do u make the lines?
Friday, January 29, 2016 at 12:30am PST
same hahaha
Friday, January 29, 2016 at 12:02am PST
=)
Friday, January 29, 2016 at 12:02am PST
tbh im just going to leave a line blank in my conclusion and then ask lily what she put tmrr
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:59pm PST
 
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:53pm PST
AHAHA thanks
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:53pm PST
Wait Nvm
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:53pm PST
The graph doesn't fit on my paper tho
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:52pm PST
but i guess ill put like 1 or something :/
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:52pm PST
i was hoping you guys would have an answer
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:51pm PST
but what did you put for reaction order then
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:51pm PST
for conclusion i started talking about why increase in concentration increases rate of reaction lol
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:50pm PST
go to file, and then in the dropdown menu thing at the bottom it says print
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:50pm PST
rate of reaction
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:49pm PST
Or how to even print out the graph
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:49pm PST
Umm guys idk what were calculating
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:49pm PST
idk what to write in the conclusion then lol
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:47pm PST
yeah thats the part im confused about too
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:46pm PST
cuz it does double for 2M but then 4M idk what I'm doing
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:46pm PST
idk lol
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:46pm PST
also what did u get for reaction order?
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:44pm PST
^ *
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:44pm PST
6my life
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:44pm PST
fake it till you make it
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:44pm PST
i mostly just guess my way through chem =)
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:44pm PST
LOL uh not really
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:42pm PST
you always know what to do
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:42pm PST
alright hahaha thanks jessica
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:42pm PST
rate i think?
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:41pm PST
was the rate just rate or was it rate law
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:40pm PST
in those tables we saw in our reaction order finding worksheets
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:40pm PST
yeah
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:40pm PST
haha same
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:40pm PST
although i think we are suppsoed to find reaction order
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:40pm PST
ok good hahah
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:40pm PST
uh :/ i dont think so?
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:39pm PST
were we supposed to use the rate law equation in our lab somewhere
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:32pm PST
xie xie
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:30pm PST
0.5 for both 4 and 6M
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:30pm PST
0.5 2M
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:30pm PST
0.55 1M
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:29pm PST
Kk
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:14pm PST
thanks!
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:14pm PST
sorry can someone send me the grams of CaCO3 that we used for each concentration
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 8:52pm PST
um i think so
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 8:48pm PST
Is that instantaneous
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 8:48pm PST
What is initial rate
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 8:43pm PST
But idk
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 8:43pm PST
There wasn't one on Emily's graph
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 8:08pm PST
is there supposed to be a curve of best fit for the graph?
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 7:31pm PST
idk does it matter as long as we find that rate for all of them? tbh im sort of confused
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 7:31pm PST
and um
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 7:31pm PST
wait where does it say that?
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 7:29pm PST
and since it says or which do we choose lol
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 7:29pm PST
So does that mean averaging on the initials
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 7:29pm PST
there's a part that says avg initial
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 7:24pm PST
" Graph the results obtained for each trial and calculate the average or initial rate for each concentration of HCl. "
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 6:50pm PST
The average rate?
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 6:04pm PST
So for the lab what are we calculating exactly lol
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 6:40pm PST
;)
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 1:37pm PST
Wait forreals??
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 1:23pm PST

Monday, January 4, 2016 at 9:57pm PST
Ok
Monday, January 4, 2016 at 9:57pm PST
oh
Monday, January 4, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
It's basically the same thing we did before break, but now we need to find the second equation because we don't have NH4Cl
Monday, January 4, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
We need to find the heat of reaction for the 2nd equation using the first and third ones
Monday, January 4, 2016 at 9:40pm PST
no idea lol
Monday, January 4, 2016 at 9:23pm PST
Wait so which equation are we using for the lab?
Sunday, January 3, 2016 at 12:31am PST
 
Saturday, January 2, 2016 at 11:23pm PST
Oh AHAH that's smart
Saturday, January 2, 2016 at 11:00pm PST
I'm not sure, you could try it with a few strands of hair first to see what happens?
Saturday, January 2, 2016 at 10:46pm PST
So umm... If I wash my hair with that blue fingerprint soap. Will my hair become blue?
Tuesday, December 29, 2015 at 1:30pm PST
Ok thank u
Tuesday, December 29, 2015 at 1:05pm PST
Yesh I think so
Tuesday, December 29, 2015 at 12:58pm PST
So just ace too.
Tuesday, December 29, 2015 at 12:47pm PST
Yes
Tuesday, December 29, 2015 at 12:47pm PST

Tuesday, December 29, 2015 at 12:47pm PST
I think rest, but also ace?
Tuesday, December 29, 2015 at 12:46pm PST
Guys? For the packet is the rest also ace or all of them?

wrong chat lol
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 1:57am PST
i know this is a lot to ask but can you send me your lab when your done so i can make sure i have everything you have
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 1:30am PST
alright thanks hahaha
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 1:27am PST
i'll let u know if i come up with a better one '

tyty
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 1:26am PST
oh ok hahahah
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 1:25am PST
like "the scale could have not been precise" or something
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 1:25am PST
tbh i always blame the equpiment haha cause i usually dont know what else to write
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 1:17am PST
ideas for sources of error?
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 12:14am PST
=)
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 12:14am PST
lol thanks
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 12:08am PST

thanks
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 12:02am PST
oh hahaha ok
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 12:02am PST
but i would do it in formal lab
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 12:02am PST
haha no that far yet
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 12:02am PST
for the ap chemistry review questions at the end, did you just do the calculations in the formal lab or did you do it on binder paper
Tuesday, December 15, 2015 at 11:18pm PST
Np
Tuesday, December 15, 2015 at 11:11pm PST
okayy thank you =)
Tuesday, December 15, 2015 at 11:10pm PST
she told me sample is fine
Tuesday, December 15, 2015 at 11:08pm PST
or just sample?
Tuesday, December 15, 2015 at 11:08pm PST
wait are we supposed to show all of the calculations in our formal lab?
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 11:56pm PST
true true
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 11:56pm PST
cant redo this a third time
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 11:56pm PST
even if its wrong im just going to go with it lol
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 11:56pm PST
haha ok
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 11:56pm PST
can we compare tomorrow lmao
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 11:55pm PST
idk if i did it right
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 11:55pm PST
oh crap
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 11:55pm PST
like 2000 something J i thunk
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 11:43pm PST
lol sorry to bother you guys again but what did you get for the change of heat for MgSO4
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 10:58pm PST

i was thinking the same thing but i just wanted to make sure you guys weren't either hahahah
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 10:54pm PST
lol she didnt exactly say lab notebook.. so nah
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 10:54pm PST
ok cool
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 10:53pm PST
Binder paper
Monday, December 14, 2015 at 10:51pm PST
are you guys actually writing out the procedure or are you guys just gonna show her the binder paper
Friday, December 11, 2015 at 6:42am PST
That's what Eric told me
Friday, December 11, 2015 at 6:42am PST
Isn't tmix hot temperature - intial cold temperature?
Friday, December 11, 2015 at 1:02am PST
wait i thought the tmix was 39.5
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:49pm PST
Something went wrong and btw our initial is higher than tmix
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:49pm PST
 
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:41pm PST
lmao sorry i got home kinda late and haven't started chem so i have no idea
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:40pm PST
Omg thanks AHAHA
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:40pm PST
39.5
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:39pm PST
Cuz Zoe we don't...
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:33pm PST
wait do u have final temp for part a?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:30pm PST
kk
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:27pm PST
Aha Itsok but just tell me when UR doing chem
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:27pm PST
sorry currently doing math so not completley understanding
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:26pm PST
idk
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:26pm PST
Wait do u understand? Or does that not matter?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:26pm PST
oh no
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:26pm PST
oh
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:25pm PST
And the other ones we used more water right? So the mass of water would be different but we can use that to find the Ccal Becuz we didn't have hot water we just used regular water
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:24pm PST
So our calculations would be small our CCAL
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:24pm PST
So yenno how we used less water for the original one?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:24pm PST
PROBLEM??
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:24pm PST
GUYS OK I THINK I HAVE A PROBLEM
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:23pm PST
Wait nvm ignore that
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:16pm PST
And my tmix is 39
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:16pm PST
But for part A. My Ccal is 103.71 j/c
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:15pm PST
Ahaa ok. Well I'm sort of getting lost
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:14pm PST
considering that i wont do them until later tonight, depends on what time youre sleeping lol
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 11:13pm PST
Are we going to compare the calculations with each other?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:31pm PST
Ok thanks
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:27pm PST
bc equation 3 and 4 are essentially the same, just moved around
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:27pm PST
yeah it makes sense
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:27pm PST
i think so?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:27pm PST
um
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:24pm PST
Tmix-tavg?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:24pm PST
so its just change in temp times Ccal
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:24pm PST
Oh.
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:23pm PST
 
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:23pm PST
Santa Clara
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:23pm PST
Oh AHAHA where's that?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:23pm PST
wait whats the equation
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:23pm PST
the delay of strengthening the Anderson Reservoir. lol so boring
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:22pm PST
Wait I don't get the Qcal equation.
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:22pm PST
AHAHA ok. What's urs about?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:22pm PST
proofreading atm
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:21pm PST
Did u?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:21pm PST
I just finished well I'll proofread it in like 30 minutes but yeah
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:21pm PST
Yep.
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:21pm PST
did u already finish your CE?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:21pm PST
haha ok
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:20pm PST
Nvm I found it
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:20pm PST
And is there a unit for c cal?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:20pm PST
Oh yes ok thank u. I wasn't sure Becuz the equation on the lab doesn't have the negative sign
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:19pm PST
does that sounds right lol
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:19pm PST
so water is then releasing heat? so negative?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:19pm PST
well we know that Ccal is positive because it is absorbing heat
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:17pm PST
Wait is q water supposed to be positive or negative?
Thursday, December 10, 2015 at 9:17pm PST
 
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 8:39pm PST
Kk I was getting worried
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 8:39pm PST
yes lol
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 8:38pm PST
Is UR backgrounds really long?
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 8:37pm PST
Hmm. Ok thanks
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 8:36pm PST
idk if thats right though
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 8:36pm PST
so i didn't have to use Cp of solid a
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 8:36pm PST
and changed it to negative for H of the solution
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 8:36pm PST
i calculated the energy change for water
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 7:47pm PST
Cool
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 7:45pm PST
will send once i do it
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 7:41pm PST
Hey for prelab #2 what's the cp for solid a?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:18pm PST
haha true
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:17pm PST
More to put in conclusion hahaha
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:17pm PST
oh well
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:16pm PST
yeah i already did calculations too
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:16pm PST
It would be suspicious
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:16pm PST
It's just that if me and her both do it
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:16pm PST
But I could cross it out
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:16pm PST
and yea.. but shes not here :/
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:15pm PST
I did hahah
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:15pm PST
and it would be suspicious if she already did it
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:15pm PST
lol did you already do all the calculations for it ho
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:15pm PST
but we need lily to be on board with this also hahaha
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:15pm PST
truee
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:15pm PST
I guess we could change it if we want
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:15pm PST
thats not TOO MUCH more...
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:15pm PST
well
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:14pm PST
For Kristy's group their temperature change was 5 while ours was 2
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:12pm PST
=( lol okay
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:12pm PST
oh
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:07pm PST
so all we can do is just mention it in our conclusion that we messed up somehow lol
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:06pm PST
Kristy*
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:06pm PST
Ok so Krispy sentme her lab and our part b doesn't make sense because the temperature of our water barely changed
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:03pm PST
lol
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:03pm PST
idk I hope not
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:03pm PST
idk does it matter
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:03pm PST
negative?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:02pm PST
um
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:02pm PST
Is it supposed to be negative or positive
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:02pm PST
experimenta; heat of fusion 253.9 J/g
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 11:02pm PST
our percent error is 23.88
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:58pm PST
Huh?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:55pm PST
SORRY
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:55pm PST
looool
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:54pm PST
OOPS
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:54pm PST
J/G
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:54pm PST
BUT ACCEPTED VALUE WE'RE COMPARING IS KJ.G
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:54pm PST
BC SORRY THE EQUATION I TOLD YOU FOR HEAT OF FUSION WAS KJ/MOL
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:54pm PST
ITS NOT 1270%
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:54pm PST
???
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:53pm PST
I MADE A MISTAKE
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:53pm PST
OH SORRY
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:21pm PST
lol omg
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:21pm PST
󾌴󾌴󾌴󾌴
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:21pm PST
In her head. Ofc Vicky's group would get a 1270% error
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:21pm PST
Fault
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:21pm PST
Omg if ms. Liu sees that I think she's gonna think it was my fult
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:20pm PST
omg lol
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:20pm PST
Oh yeah whoops missing one zero 󾌴󾌴󾌴
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:20pm PST
No she keeps record herself
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:20pm PST
lol int that like 1270%
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:20pm PST
When'd she give us late passes!!?!??
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:20pm PST
Dang AHAHA I might just turn this one in late Becuz im so lost and I need great gatsby test
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:20pm PST
i think so? i dont remember how many it was
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:19pm PST
Divided by 0.334
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:19pm PST
Oh AHAH well 4.59- 0.334 right
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:19pm PST
Wait she gives us like 2 late passes?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:19pm PST
lol i thought it would be more
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:19pm PST
bc she has a late pass thing
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:19pm PST
Percent error that's huge?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:19pm PST
um technically yes
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:19pm PST
wait only 127%?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:19pm PST
Can we turn in our labs late?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:19pm PST
I don't get this...
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:18pm PST
󾌴󾌴󾌴
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:18pm PST
Percent error 127%
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:17pm PST
=(
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:17pm PST
Fuck...
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:17pm PST
Yeah it's in Kj Becuz that's what it says in calculation.
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:17pm PST
yeah i think so
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:17pm PST
bc if its kj we're hecka off
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:17pm PST
I think so
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:17pm PST
So the accepted value is 0.334 Kj for ice?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:17pm PST
also what units is your heat of fusion?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:16pm PST
5.81 kj?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:16pm PST
.91 j right?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:16pm PST
That's so off for 0.91 󾌯󾌯󾌯
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:16pm PST
yea
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:15pm PST
Oh and did u get 5.81 for specific heat of metal?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:15pm PST
Oh yeah some said that and some said Kj idk
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:11pm PST
when i googled it it said 333.55 j/g
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:09pm PST
??
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:08pm PST
Kj
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:08pm PST
So the heat of fusion of ice is supposed to be 334 Kk
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:08pm PST
Kristy got 4 something and Samast got 6 something I think
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:08pm PST
sloe enough
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:08pm PST
4.57 but yeah
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:07pm PST
So the heat of fusion I got is 4.59 did u get that?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:06pm PST
that we got in the first part
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:06pm PST
for the mass of water i used the mass of water minus the mass of empty cup
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:06pm PST
cause u get like 2.89 * 10^-4 kj, at least using the mass u used
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:05pm PST
it kind of makes sense?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:05pm PST
oh shit i didi something wrong
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:04pm PST
uhh google
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:04pm PST
lol idk
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:04pm PST
actually your answer seems plausible?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:03pm PST
Wait what's the accepted quantities?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:03pm PST
crap HAHAHHA
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:03pm PST
but the answer the way we did it seems wrong
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:02pm PST
i did the same thing as you, except i got a differnt number for mass of water
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:01pm PST
Ok
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:00pm PST
7.53
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 10:00pm PST
Wait what did u get for UR q for ice?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:59pm PST
Kk thanks
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:59pm PST
 
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:59pm PST
ice
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:59pm PST
soo
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:59pm PST
youre finding the heat of fusion for ice
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:59pm PST
The q for water or ice
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:59pm PST
Oh!!
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:59pm PST
you solve it
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:59pm PST
imma send you pics cuz idk what the hell I did
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:58pm PST
What's delta h?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:58pm PST
so you use the value of q you calculated earlier
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:58pm PST
q = n delta h
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:58pm PST
yeah thats what i did
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:58pm PST
i dont think its the same as water
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:58pm PST
Cuz u said its n(delta h)
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:57pm PST
And wats the delta h for the fusion of ice
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:57pm PST
Wait so it's the same as water just one positive and one negative?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:57pm PST
Same thing for water?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:57pm PST
uhh we dont have delta T of ice?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:56pm PST
Right?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:55pm PST
For the ice gained U use mass of ice and the cp of ice
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:55pm PST
Mhm
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:55pm PST
:/
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:55pm PST
i got a huge number :
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:55pm PST
zoe what did you get for specific heat of metal?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:52pm PST
idk
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:52pm PST
wait if u calculate heat lost by water dont you use the water mass and specific heat?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:51pm PST
Oh AHAHA ok thanks
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:51pm PST
sorry i meant delta T
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:51pm PST
Wait so then what's the delta h?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:51pm PST
 
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:50pm PST
Heat absorbed by ice do I used the cp of ice and the mass of ice?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:50pm PST
Oh ok thanks
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:50pm PST
?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:50pm PST
so heat lost is negatve, heat absorbed is positive
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:50pm PST
For ice? In the first equation?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:49pm PST
absorbed is opposite of heat lost
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:49pm PST
Or absorbed?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:49pm PST
u plug in mass, specific heat, and change in temp
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:49pm PST
Thanks wat about gained?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:49pm PST
Kk
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:49pm PST
for fusion of ice i used q=ndeltaH
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:48pm PST
At least rn
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:48pm PST
Sorry I'm really bad at thermochemistry
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:48pm PST
And then?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:48pm PST
Kk.
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:48pm PST
for heat lost
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:48pm PST
T*
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:48pm PST
use the equation q=mCpdeltaH
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:47pm PST
The mass of ice melted is 29.69
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:47pm PST
Like all like the heat lost and gained and the fusion of ice
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:46pm PST
which ones
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 9:36pm PST
Wait how do u do calculations?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 8:04pm PST
np
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 8:04pm PST
mp
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 8:00pm PST
Kk thanks
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 7:50pm PST
and yes, pretty sure its just conclusion
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 7:50pm PST
lol i think i did my part B wrong too
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 7:16pm PST
Wait rock candy is just conclusion right?
Thursday, December 3, 2015 at 6:37pm PST
I think I did something wrong for part b lol can someone send a pic when done

Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 8:47pm PDT
Also do we have to fix the doc?
Tuesday, April 25, 2017 at 8:47pm PDT
Do we have an econ test tom?
Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 8:22pm PDT
Lol k I'll do the same then
Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 8:22pm PDT
Not for each question

Like 3 altogether
Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 8:21pm PDT
I just did 3
Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 8:20pm PDT
Or do we have to do it for every possible answer
Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 8:20pm PDT
And also for specific examples how many do we have to do for each part
Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 8:12pm PDT
K thx for the info
Sunday, April 23, 2017 at 8:12pm PDT
But i just copy pasted everything on the doc into the ppt

Hey Lily & Denise! I'm placing the ID numbers of our recyclers next to their names in the google sheet. It's a fairly slow process, so if you guys could lend a hand whenever you have time, it would be greatly appreciated. And thank you so much Lily for all the inputting of hours you do! <3

Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:38pm PDT
yay :D i'm super interested in u mass amherst but it's out of state so my parents probably won't send me there. ahahahaha ty for the compliment michelle but i'll probably be at the bottom 25% at MIT even if i get in (which is a 0.0001% chance)
Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:36pm PDT
well at least you got a college tour :) i haven't visited a single college yet :/

omg the museum sounds super cool. the fact that you couldn't get through all of it reminds me of my visit to disney world (bc my family basically explored like 15% of it haha)
Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:34pm PDT

Woah the dark fields sounds, catch 22 and slaughterhouse five sound like good books. I better start reading them lol. I haven't had much time to read this summer so I don't have any book recommendations sorry :(
Monday, August 15, 2016 at 2:15pm PDT
I'm sure you will get into MIT. You're super smart and Mit would totally miss out if they don't accept you.

Ohh one of my TA's at brown goes to u mass Amherst. He said it's pretty cool there
Monday, August 15, 2016 at 2:13pm PDT
Also, I went to tour Boston university, northeastern university, and Harvard which was fun.
Monday, August 15, 2016 at 2:13pm PDT
We actually went to a lot of places in Boston, but by far my favorite was the museum of fine arts. It's huge. I spent like 4 hours there and didn't even get through half of the museum
Monday, August 15, 2016 at 2:12pm PDT
Aha it's okay. I'm just starting early because my mom has been constantly bugging me about it 😅
Monday, August 15, 2016 at 2:11pm PDT

Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:29pm PDT
wow i wrote so much. i am continually amazed that i still know english amidst all my slacking this summer
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:28pm PDT
oh yeah, what have you been reading lately? i'm looking for recommendations :))
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:28pm PDT
but on a different note, i've been reading "catch 22." did you like "the things we carried" from last year? bc if you did, you'll love this book and "slaughterhouse five"
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:27pm PDT
ahaha tbh link crew was kind of last minute bc i was wondering if i was suited to be around freshmen (someone once told me i kind of weird people out on a regular basis bc i'm too intense with studying) so i didn't get the chance to tell you
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:26pm PDT
exactly. i wish she at least confirmed with us or something :/ oh well. ty for checking though, that makes me feel more relieved :))
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:24pm PDT
omg same. i just read "the dark fields" which spawned a tv show (it got canceled, but i still think it's awesome) called "Limitless." it's sci fi and the premise is a neuroenhancing drug called NZT that can make you super-smart but with side-effects like temporal displacement
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:23pm PDT
but i'm thinking about applying to the uc's and a couple of private colleges like u mass amherst, u wisconsin, and stuff. my parents want me to apply to mit but let's be honest, i'm definitely not getting in haha
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:22pm PDT
yw :) i'm good at pep talks. i should totally be a personal trainer (not).
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:21pm PDT

Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:20pm PDT
SAME we literally had 1 class together so far :/ but i'm not looking forward to apeng this year. i feel like the summer drained away all my nonexistent analysis skills
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:19pm PDT
hmm i always thought the east coast would be cool-ish. it's interesting that it's hot though (future note for college haha) but wow your summer sounds as amazing as mine :) did you go sightseeing anywhere though? lol idk what's near boston off the top of my head

wow i wish i was as ahead as you are :/ i've been reading head first java to distract myself. i'm such a procrastinator
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 10:17pm PDT
omg gwc was amazing :))) i mean, i'm not the friendliest and nicest person in the world but nobody was judgmental and we ended up learning a lot about programming :) i made an android app for my final project!
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 1:12pm PDT
Btw, I didn't know you were doing link crew??
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 1:12pm PDT
Don't worry, you are still in link crew. I checked the email from forever ago. 😂
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 1:12pm PDT
 
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 1:11pm PDT
Yeah she hasn't sent out an email yet which I'm worried about BC it's coming so soon.
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 1:10pm PDT
My summer has been super busy. Just trying to do college apps, reading, stuff like that. You?
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 1:09pm PDT
Ahah thank for the pep talk. I'll try my best and hope for the best. Just curious, which colleges are you applying to?
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 1:09pm PDT
I'm praying that we have at least one same class. It's been too long 😞 and omg lily you have to pace yourself with your ap classes. I don't want you to be too stressed
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 1:08pm PDT
The east coast was super hot. But Boston was pretty fun. And the summer program was really fun. I felt like I got to meet a lot of new people so that was cool
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 1:07pm PDT
lol I just finished worrying two rough drafts of the uc essays it's so hard 😭
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 1:07pm PDT
It's okay haha. How was gwc??
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:17am PDT
^ sorry for bothering you with all of my problems :( i just don't want to show up randomly on the 18th without being expected haha
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:16am PDT
oh btw, do you know where the link crew training is supposed to be and are you supposed to know your partners already? sorry for bothering you about this but idk i thought mrs. smith was going to send us an email or something just to confirm and i didn't get anything... so i'm wondering if i'm even supposed to be on link crew anymore lol
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:13am PDT
wow, wall of text
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:13am PDT
but how was your summer so far?
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:12am PDT
:/ this is why i wish they showed percentages on transcripts. was this even after the extra formal lab thing?
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:11am PDT
:) wow i just gave you an unnecessary pep talk. pls ignore the above lol. i'm on lifesavers rn
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:10am PDT
and if a college doesn't take you, they don't deserve you
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:10am PDT
i realize this is super late but you shouldn't have been stressed at all :) even for chem (which i think was the hardest exam next to physics) bc you're one of the smartest and most hardworking people i know and colleges don't even care that much about ap scores (at least the common app, i think)
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:07am PDT
same. the journals were super irritating and the way she graded them in the 1st sem didn't even make sense :/ although i think the fact that i wrote like a gajillion pages made it look like i did work although i basically just wrote garbage that wouldn't have made it past the gialdini filter
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:06am PDT
i hope i don't burn out in college :((
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:05am PDT
yay! :) i really want to get my schedule so i can compare classes. ugh idk why i'm taking that many aps. i care way too much about what colleges think of my 'rigorous schedule' but tbh i think i secretly like staying up at night to study
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:04am PDT
wow now i'm interrogating you
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:04am PDT
OMG you went to the east coast?! i've never been there! i've always wanted to go to boston or nyc bc well they're the epitomes of east coast culture but i never got the chance. how was it? how was brown? did you like your summer program?
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:03am PDT
colleges: we're all unique snowflakes so you need to say something different from everyone else to get in me: i'm literally the most un-unique person there is
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:02am PDT
btw you're probably ahead on me on college apps and essays bc i've been so lazy regarding them. yeah, i'm also worried about making myself stand out bc tbh i'm not even really that special but whatever.
Sunday, August 14, 2016 at 11:01am PDT
michelleeee!! sorry for not replying for so long! i haven't been on fb for more than a month (gwc took up like 95% of my time) and after i returned like a week ago, i didn't notice this until now :/
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 8:04pm PDT
TBH I'm so stressed out about ap scores especially chem 😞 I'm so sad BC I ended the last semester with an 89.73% and Liu refused to round and I literally cried.
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 8:04pm PDT
Lol I miss sitting next to you in English but I actually really disliked the class. Too many journals 😒
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 8:03pm PDT
Yay 2 classes at least and really? OMG lily why are you taking so many aps?? 😫😫
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 8:03pm PDT
Yeah brown is on the east coast and I'm staying there for 2 weeks but I'm leaving going to Boston to sight see first. Have you been there?
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 8:02pm PDT
Lol I don't do cs but it seems really interesting though. And haha yeah. Just gotta write an essay that stands out but it's so hard omg :(
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:46pm PDT
btw some realtor was putting american flags in front of houses and i got really weirded out when i saw them lol
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:46pm PDT
omg ap scores coming right after 4th of july
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:45pm PDT
:)
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:45pm PDT
wow i'm lame
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:45pm PDT
although tbh you should more than me :))) bc you're the singer
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:45pm PDT
lol i'm really good at talking and rambling. i think i like listening to the sound of my own voice haha
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:45pm PDT
SAME. remember english h in soph year and how i'd always randomly talk to you when we'd have to discuss things
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:43pm PDT
YES apes, apeng :) i hope we have these classes together. tbh i'm taking all aps next year. i'm going to die :'(
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:43pm PDT
OMG you're going to brown? i think you told me about this before! i'm sure you'll be fine, remember that you're the queen of conic sections :D also is brown on the east coast? how long are you going to stay there? are you going to go sightseeing too? have you ever been to new york? (cue an influx of questions from me)
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:41pm PDT
answer: idk i want to get a job when i graduate (basically everyone's essays except the ppl admitted know how to hide it the best lol)
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:40pm PDT
ikr i still haven't done any research yet and i'm wondering how i'm going to answer the question "why do you want to go to [blah] university"
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:40pm PDT
:) it is! we're learning python now. btw do you program? (omg if you do i'm going to be really excited bc cs really needs more girls to code [now i sound like an advertisement haha])
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 2:39pm PDT
How about you? Omg it's been too long since we had a class together 😞 I'm praying that we will have at least one class together next year.
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 2:39pm PDT
And I'm taking apes, apeng, ap psych, calc, gov/Econ, and TA for mr Brady
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 2:38pm PDT
My summer has been okay. I'm actually about to go to Brown University for a summer program lol. Hopefully it isn't too hard
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 2:38pm PDT
Yeah college apps are so stressful ugh. My parents are also bugging me to start writing the essays lol
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 2:37pm PDT

Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:47pm PDT

Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:46pm PDT

Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:46pm PDT

Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:46pm PDT
but i guess i'm learning a lot of new stuff (i'm in girls who code rn :) ) about programming
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:45pm PDT
college apps are so close and my parents keep bugging me to make a resume and all those app accounts haha
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:45pm PDT

Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:45pm PDT

aha enough sleep
Thursday, November 5, 2015 at 8:25pm PST
Exactly! I feel like the literature side of English was far easier (remember wilkie? lol) than the language stuff we're doing this year :(
Thursday, November 5, 2015 at 8:24pm PST
That's good. Just make sure you are getting enough sleep.
Thursday, November 5, 2015 at 8:24pm PST
Same. I accidentally keep analyzing it in literature style and then I remembered we were suppose to analyze it with diction and stuff.
Thursday, November 5, 2015 at 8:23pm PST
lol i haven't pull an all-nighter yet so i'm doing well?
Thursday, November 5, 2015 at 8:23pm PST

Thursday, September 17, 2015 at 7:38pm PDT
I did P(atm) = P(water)+P(hydrogen) -- dalton's law of partial pressures. yeah exactly what you said
Thursday, September 17, 2015 at 7:37pm PDT
Yeah. So do you just subtract vapor pressure from room pressure?
Thursday, September 17, 2015 at 7:37pm PDT
Same. Can high school just be over.
Thursday, September 17, 2015 at 7:37pm PDT

Wait, I don't think I did a title either.
Thursday, September 17, 2015 at 7:34pm PDT
I hope she takes the time into account.
Thursday, September 17, 2015 at 7:34pm PDT
I don't know, somehow i feel like last year, I would have cared more about doing badly in gialdini but, I just felt meh after the essay.
Thursday, September 17, 2015 at 7:32pm PDT
Our group forgot a title oops.
Thursday, September 17, 2015 at 7:32pm PDT
It's okay. Same. It was so hard to write anything in like a short period of time

Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 9:02pm PDT

Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:59pm PDT
And we should totally go to a concert together one day. Just crazily dance and sing everything at the top of our lungs. 󾌴
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:58pm PDT
And yeah that's good. Relax now and then power through the 9 months.
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:58pm PDT

Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:58pm PDT
Wow michelle i'd really like to see you at the concert
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:57pm PDT

Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:57pm PDT
lol i think that a lot of the time too :) but then i remember school's going to be hard so i'm relaxing now when i still can
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:56pm PDT

Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:55pm PDT
Ooh I went to her concert like a week ago and I screamed all her lyrics and danced like a crazy person haha. Everyone was staring at me.
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:54pm PDT
Really? Does she not like her?
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:54pm PDT
Ohh yes Netflix is amazing yet so addicting. And haha my life is really pathetic. Sometimes I'm like do I even have friends? ._.
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:53pm PDT
my sister should never know i listen to her
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:53pm PDT
taylor swift is amazing (my guilty pleasure tbh)
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:53pm PDT
ofc you probs have a busier, less pathetic life lo
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:53pm PDT
ahahahah lol my so many other things includes binge-watching netflix all day long
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:50pm PDT
How about you?
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:50pm PDT
I actually listen to a variety of music but a lot of taylor swift ( May or May not be a little obsessed with her lol)
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:50pm PDT
Haha true. Even though books are interesting, I would rather do so many other things. And what?? No complicated is an awesome song.
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:49pm PDT
what do you generally listen to?
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:49pm PDT
i was just singing along to complicated the other day and my sister said it was a stupid song :((( she only listens to classical music (what a boring life lol)
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:48pm PDT
yeah exactly. it makes no sense, but maybe she wants us to keep up our analytical skills? i mean, if she didn't assign it, i wouldn't have read any books (shh don't tell her i said that)
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:45pm PDT
Lol I love that song. And yeah. I mean won't we remember a lot more anyways if we read it during the school year?
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:44pm PDT
^ i would sing that song to all the ap teachers LOLOL
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:44pm PDT
it's actually not that complicated, but truman capote makes it complicated :( (insert complicated by april lavigne lol)
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:43pm PDT
that's why i checked out the wikipedia page so i could get the facts straight
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:43pm PDT
yeah. idk why gialdini made us read the books then? oh well. yeah, ik the book changes focus quickly
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:41pm PDT
Lol yeah. But I had like 2 months to finished them so I better finish them soon anyways. And ah I see. At first I was so confused bc they started talking about the clutters and then the book started talking about perry and dick
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:40pm PDT
the motive was stealing
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:40pm PDT
they wanted to kill the clutters bc they heard there would be like $10000 in their safe
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:39pm PDT
oh ok. if that's true we have literally nothing to worry about. i think jessica said that too. you're right! you shouldn't worry about the books then lol
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:39pm PDT
Ikr. Ughh. Wait lily I actually heard the essay on the first day is not about the two books? It's just a random one from the released ap English test from college board??
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:38pm PDT
Haha not really but I will try lol. Wait lily can you tell me why perry and dick from in cold blood wanted to kill the clutters? Lol I really want to know now and I don't mind spoilers
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:37pm PDT
:\ i just wish we didn't have the essay on the first day
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:37pm PDT
you'll be ok though :))) michelle always has it together :)
Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:36pm PDT

Saturday, August 22, 2015 at 8:31pm PDT
MICHELLE :) yes same mysteries are amazing (do you watch sherlock?) i actually like the devil in the white city, for some reason it was really interesting
Wednesday, August 19, 2015 at 2:15pm PDT
Ah I see. I like the aspect of mystery so pretty interesting. Which of the 2 books did you like best?
Wednesday, August 19, 2015 at 1:47pm PDT

jessica was saying it was a college board prompt
Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 11:22pm PDT

Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 11:21pm PDT
Like both of them?

Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 11:14pm PDT

Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 4:51pm PDT
True. We can help each other for gialdini
Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 4:50pm PDT
Same. I actually had 3rd period chem but I switched out to choir. 󾌱 since they originally gave me art
Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 4:50pm PDT
oh well, at least we can talk about labs together even if we don't do them together
Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 4:50pm PDT
i thought this was statistically impossible tbh
Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 4:49pm PDT
i'm grieving rn
Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 4:49pm PDT
noooooo
Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 4:49pm PDT

Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 4:49pm PDT
:'( :'( :'(
Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 4:48pm PDT
I tried to ask the office if I could switch into 6th period gialdini but they said no space.
Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 4:47pm PDT
But differnt periods. Like why.
Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 4:47pm PDT
Same teachers for chem and english
Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 4:47pm PDT
I'm crying. 󾌺󾌺
Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 4:47pm PDT

Tuesday, August 18, 2015 at 11:32am PDT
LILY I AM SO SAD
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:19pm PDT
Oh yeah true. Hopefully you guys will be in the same lab group then
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:18pm PDT
And I heard gialdini is scary but grades easier. But smith is more approachable but grades harder
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:18pm PDT
Yeah I can move on to choir 2.
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:18pm PDT
not that she'd be a bad partner, but i really wish we could be in the same lab group
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:17pm PDT
yes, i hope so! except someone might be between us like saisha or something
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:17pm PDT
aha is gialdini better than smith?
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:17pm PDT
michelle it's all right :) can you take choir again senior year even if you take it junior year? just curious
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:16pm PDT
Lol yeah since you guys' last names are close
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:16pm PDT
But I could have taken choir senior year. So I could have been in your class. And yeah. I'm praying for 6th period gialdini
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:14pm PDT
wait maybe we'll have apeng together? 6th period
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:14pm PDT
also, i have jessica :) maybe we'll be in the same lab group
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:14pm PDT
i would never let you not take it just to make me feel unalone
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:14pm PDT
you love choir
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:14pm PDT
NO
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:14pm PDT
oh well, that's all right
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:14pm PDT
noononononononon omg :'( :'( i was hoping we would have liu together
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:13pm PDT
Dang it. Why did I have to take choir
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:13pm PDT
Okay so basically I saw on a friend's schedule that choir is 3rd period and I think there is only 1 period of choir. Since ap chem is only 1st and 3rd period, it means that I have 1st period chem and 3rd period choir. This makes me so sad bc I wanted chem with you. 󾌺󾌺󾌺
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:12pm PDT
how do you know?
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:12pm PDT
you have to be in chem with me
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:12pm PDT
nooooo
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:12pm PDT
what? why?
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:09pm PDT
Haha thanks. I actually figured out that we probably won't have chem together. :(
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:09pm PDT
Haha it's okay. Actually idk if she's going to go with me since she might have something to do.
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:08pm PDT
*internet hug*
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:08pm PDT
:)
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:08pm PDT

Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:08pm PDT
I'm so anxious right now. :/
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:08pm PDT

Monday, August 17, 2015 at 10:08pm PDT

Monday, August 17, 2015 at 4:03pm PDT

Monday, August 17, 2015 at 2:56pm PDT

Yeah that's so strange. And hopefully. I would be so happy. :)
Monday, August 17, 2015 at 2:47pm PDT

Monday, August 17, 2015 at 2:47pm PDT

Cosmos is at several uc campuses
Thursday, July 16, 2015 at 9:35pm PDT

Wednesday, July 15, 2015 at 10:03pm PDT
Where exactly is cosmos at?
Wednesday, July 15, 2015 at 10:03pm PDT
Yess baking for sure. I'm looking forward to it. :)

Tuesday, July 14, 2015 at 8:12am PDT
Well I actually volunteered at a summer camp for a week awhile ago. It was pretty fun. Then the rest of the time I got really really sick so I couldn't do much. :/
Tuesday, July 14, 2015 at 8:11am PDT
What's your snapchat username? I'll try to add you. And tbh we should just bribe the people who do our schedules to make sure we have those 2 classes together. 󾌴
Tuesday, July 14, 2015 at 6:27am PDT
♡ I just realized I haven't seen/talked to you in such a long time :'(
Tuesday, July 14, 2015 at 6:26am PDT

Tuesday, July 14, 2015 at 6:25am PDT

Friday, March 27, 2015 at 8:08pm PDT
And ikr. Can Riley just take the rest of the year off?
Friday, March 27, 2015 at 8:07pm PDT
And of course you aren't a bad friend! I prefer listening haha. And it's okay. It was my fault anyways, I'll just do better next time I guess. But thabks for trying to comfort me though. :)
Friday, March 27, 2015 at 8:06pm PDT

Friday, March 27, 2015 at 7:11pm PDT
glee club! you're totes good at singing :)
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 10:07pm PDT
It's okay. I mean you love sci fi books so it's not like she can force you to do other books. And ah yeah maybe. I still need to find a club that I'm super into
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 10:05pm PDT
you should def be a publicist sometime
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 10:05pm PDT
aha ty! <3
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 10:05pm PDT

And omg this picture is very creative. Did you think of this?
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 8:24pm PDT
Yes. Wilkinson is so hard to please. Why. She must lower her standards
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 8:24pm PDT
And true. I'm excited for all the cooking we will do over the summer 󾮗
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 8:23pm PDT
I'm taking physics in senior year. And ah yeah. Only if. Then we would have more chances of being in a class with each other. :D
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 8:09pm PDT
 
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 8:01pm PDT
1) cooking gives you an excuse to meet up w/ me during the summer 2) dude are you kidding me your cakes always look amazing and wilkie says they taste amazing too and she's pretty hard to please
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 8:00pm PDT
howelllll together lol
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 8:00pm PDT
yes i wish so badly i could take ap stats w/ you :'(
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 7:59pm PDT
omg i think i mixed you up with another one of my friends. seriously, wait so are you taking physics 1 with me? sorry my terrible memory :(
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:41pm PDT
And haha. Tbh I'm not really good at cooking
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:41pm PDT
Lol I'm not taking bio next year, instead I'm taking ap stats but you'll be taking that senior year... Ah such bad timing. I'm crossing my fingers we will have both of those classes together!
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:40pm PDT
haha definitely you have to teach me how to cook without blowing up the kitchen or burning something lol
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:40pm PDT
yes i hope for that so much! especially bc you'll be taking bio and i'll have physics so the chances of being in a lot of classes together is low :(
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:38pm PDT
We also should hang out over the summer. :)
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:38pm PDT
Ikr yay. And oh yeah.. D: wait. We might have English and chem together next year. Hopefully.
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:38pm PDT

Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:14pm PDT
Oh yeah that's probably true. And yay that's good. Well we only have 3 more months of school anyways so you don't have that long to deal with him.
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:11pm PDT
well at least he sits next to saisha so i don't have to deal w/ him :)
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:10pm PDT
sometimes i think he's looking for attention bc ogni pays more attention to eshan and vedant
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:06pm PDT
And I feel bad that you have to deal with him. :(
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:05pm PDT
And really? That's rude. It seems like he likes to bother everyone.
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:05pm PDT
what i'm not popular!
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:05pm PDT
he kept saying "aj sucks" during class
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:04pm PDT
Really? Well because you are so popular. ;D
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:04pm PDT
i feel sorry for her
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:04pm PDT
he does that with aj too
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:04pm PDT
i almost never talk to her and she still knows my name o_0 maybe she wasn't concentrating? but who cares
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:01pm PDT
Lol maybe it's because I didn't talk to her often. And ahah oh yeah. Totally intruding our convos. 󾌴
Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:00pm PDT

Monday, March 23, 2015 at 6:00pm PDT

Wednesday, March 18, 2015 at 7:59pm PDT
Really? Wow tav wastes so much time. I don't want tav. :( and oh lol I meant that I was really confused when evren called wilkinson Howell. :P sorry I didn't make that clear enough
Wednesday, March 18, 2015 at 7:38pm PDT
you're both asian :D
Wednesday, March 18, 2015 at 7:38pm PDT
um idk what you mean by you "[were] like Howell" though
Wednesday, March 18, 2015 at 7:38pm PDT
even ekeruo's funnier than she is
Wednesday, March 18, 2015 at 7:37pm PDT
tav spent an hour reading the directions to the amc before she let us start .___________.
Wednesday, March 18, 2015 at 7:37pm PDT
yes she does... but you might get tav
Wednesday, March 18, 2015 at 7:30pm PDT
Haha yeah. I was like Howell? And really? Hm I see. Doesn't she also teach non honors too?
Wednesday, March 18, 2015 at 6:45pm PDT
:D
Wednesday, March 18, 2015 at 6:45pm PDT
WHICH IS WHY YOU SHOULD TAKE PRECAL H
Wednesday, March 18, 2015 at 6:44pm PDT
about 2/3rds of Howell's class ends up going to Calc BC so I'd say even if she's not easy she's a good teacher
Wednesday, March 18, 2015 at 6:44pm PDT
remember evren calling wilkie howell i thought that was super funny considering howell's asian
Wednesday, March 18, 2015 at 6:43pm PDT

Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:24am PDT

Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:24am PDT
at least they don't barge in while i'm changing bc i lock the door
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:24am PDT
aha my parents are like "we own the house so we don't have to knock"
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:23am PDT
i don't really like twilight. bella was so weak and squishy yuk
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:23am PDT
I've never really heard any guys say they like twilight
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:23am PDT
But yeah true. I guess it was very appealing to teenage girls?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:22am PDT
And really? Swimming naked seems really weird
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:22am PDT
I hate when parents just burst into the room without knocking.
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:22am PDT
so successful
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:22am PDT
but she made a lot of money off the twilight series
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:21am PDT
i'm confused
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:21am PDT
although she did talk about bella and edward swimming naked together so...
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:21am PDT
yeah i guess
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:21am PDT
Ah probably the author didn't want to get so graphic
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:21am PDT
i know nothing about couples
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:21am PDT

Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:20am PDT
Haha. Lol were you watching it by yourself and your dad just walked in?

Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 12:13am PDT

Hey lily how did it go? :)
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 8:52pm PST
You should swap the dice when he isn't looking.
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 8:51pm PST
Haha yes. Mr. Riley got angry bc everyone kept rolling the dice and it always fell on the floor so he had to pick it up. 󾌴󾌴
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 8:51pm PST
Oh yeah I do that too sometimes. And ah the pictures. I think he shouldn't have that as one of the options tbh.
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 8:51pm PST
that weighs heaviest on the '1' side.
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 8:51pm PST
I should get a trick dice.
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 8:49pm PST
I have a habit of looking up when remembering things. Aha thanks :) but knowing my luck, I'll get #3, the one that is hardest for me.
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 8:49pm PST
And yeah. I will be in ap euro praying you will get an easy one. Lol
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 8:48pm PST

Yes... I guess. I suppose I'll just see tomorrow.
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 8:48pm PST
Hopefully you're right. I would hate to just be sitting there staring at Riley awkwardly.
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 8:46pm PST
Yeah. Hopefully it's not too hard for you, :o
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 8:46pm PST
Ah yeah just try to memorize it and when you see the paper, it should all come back to you. I kinda blanked out a first but when I saw the questions again, it all came back
Wednesday, January 14, 2015 at 8:43pm PST

Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:24pm PST
Although I don't know if I'll be going into the engineering field though.
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:24pm PST
Lol that would be awesome. We could be roommates.
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:23pm PST
Those ivy leagues are so hard to get into it's actually amazing how people get in tbh
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:23pm PST
i <3 engineering :)
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:23pm PST
maybe we'll go to the same college?
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:23pm PST
although uc davis & san diego are amazing as well :)
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:23pm PST
aha i guess we'll both be out of the running for those top unis :\
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:22pm PST
yes exactly :)!!!
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:22pm PST
If we go to colleges near each other, we should visit each other sometime ☺️
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:21pm PST
I was thinking of UC Davis or ucsd maybe?
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:21pm PST
It's okay lol. I don't even want to get into those colleges bc I heard it's so competitive in there
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:21pm PST
I see. That's pretty cool. Since you like engineering and stuff it should be a good school for you :)
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:20pm PST
anyway, most of the time, the universities that contact you aren't stanford or mit if that's what you're thinking bc you only get those if you got a 240 :\
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:20pm PST
also, i think mr. licht went to rochester institute of technology :)
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:19pm PST
it also has a really good compsci/engineering program
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:19pm PST
actually, rensselaer is pretty famous for having math-oriented people there
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:19pm PST
btw i'll say funky from now on too
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:19pm PST
Ah I see. I haven't heard of them before. Where are they located?
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:18pm PST
 
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:18pm PST
ahha i actually liked rensselaer and rochester institute of technology (they're some of the ones that have contacted me so far)
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:17pm PST
Right?? Funky isn't that old. Geez people. Haha jk. I know they were only joking though. Though I realized I'm the only pesto who says funky. 󾌴󾌴
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:17pm PST
Haha. Thanks. I shall try my best. 󾮗
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:16pm PST
Ooh which colleges do you want to go to? :o
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:16pm PST
YOU"RE GOOD AT SPEAKING
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:16pm PST
I BET YOU"LL GET AN A EVEN WITH COUGHING
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:16pm PST
YOU"LL BE AMAZING
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:16pm PST
ohhh yeah coughing during the oral exam would probs make riley stare and dock points jk YOU"LL BE ABSOLUTELY FINE
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:15pm PST
the people who made fun of you are probably weird themselves ._.
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:15pm PST
funky isn't that outdated
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:15pm PST
aha like 12, but only 2-3 of them are actually colleges i'd like to go to :) lol
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:14pm PST
Ah I see that sounds good. Which colleges have contacted you so far? :o
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:13pm PST
And haha thanks lily :) and lol I remember I said funky one time and then people made fun of me
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:13pm PST
Ah yeah. It would be awkward if I start a coughing fit in the middle of the oral exam
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:13pm PST
but it makes you feel better too :)
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:13pm PST
it's advertising
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:13pm PST
basically, a bunch of colleges just contact you to tell you you did well and to look into their colleges
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:12pm PST
oh well it's not like giving out your info helps you especially
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:12pm PST
hmmm oh i see
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:12pm PST
yes, same! oh, are you not feeling well? omg i hope you're better by block day riley! ahaha at those emoticons yes, i think some people (old people lol) still say that
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:11pm PST
Oooh wait I think I've heard about it. Hm. Not sure if I gave my info out. .-,
Tuesday, January 13, 2015 at 6:11pm PST

Saturday, January 10, 2015 at 9:04pm PST

Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:03pm PST

Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:03pm PST
YES emoticons i <3 emoticons
Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:03pm PST
but yeah i see your point, there's lots of stuff to learn like ap chem and physics and math and we could forget lotf in the mix
Friday, January 9, 2015 at 10:03pm PST
ahha no i actually think we'd remember :) bc there aren't a lot of books like this one
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 9:58pm PST
And haha yay. :) these emojis are fun to use
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 9:58pm PST
And really? Wow that one point though...
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 9:58pm PST
Haha ikr. Then we would be like what? We wrote an essay in 10th grade? What's lord of the flies? .-.
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 9:24pm PST
randomness :)
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 9:24pm PST

Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 9:24pm PST
my parents wanted to yell at watson-bird bc it wasn't even english, not really
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 9:23pm PST
the dodecahedron was pure torture, plain and simple
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 9:23pm PST
just watch her give 50 minute commentaries on each of them 󾌴
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 9:22pm PST
ahahaha no wilkie (use the nickname! lol) will probably give our essays back when we graduate college
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 7:03pm PST
Lol watch wilkinson give us the essay after spring break or something. 󾌴 and oh yeah The dodecahedron was a pain in the butt I heard
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 5:50pm PST
except she made us do lots of art projects which you know i hate :|
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 5:50pm PST
yes, watson bird was probs my best english teacher ever
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 5:50pm PST
you'll be perfectly fine!
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 5:50pm PST
you didn't do badly! you actually finished early! i finished like 2 min after the bell :(
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 5:47pm PST
Some of the ap questions were kind of confusing though.
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 5:47pm PST
And um today's test was kinda hard I think I did really bad. :( and nahh I bet you did really well. :)
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 5:46pm PST
Haha Watson bird seems really cool. I wish I had her
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 5:13pm PST
ofc i know your going to get 1000000000000% :) i hate english personally
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 5:13pm PST
anyway, i'm sort of nervous about the wilkie tests today. how do you think you did?
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 5:12pm PST
and you don't need to apologize! :) it's facebook, no one's expecting you to be on it 24/7, not like me :) :)
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 5:12pm PST
i think that was the funniest thing in english class that year
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 5:11pm PST
yeah ahaha and the funniest thing was that she started laughing too and told all of us to not tell popplewell about it
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 4:59pm PST
Sorry didn't see this until now
Thursday, January 8, 2015 at 4:58pm PST
Really? Lol did mrs. Watsonbird notice it was about popplewell?
Wednesday, January 7, 2015 at 10:30pm PST
;) see you in wilkie tmrw :)
Wednesday, January 7, 2015 at 10:29pm PST
lolololol
Wednesday, January 7, 2015 at 10:29pm PST
btw did you know that a guy in watson-bird in thornton wrote a poem about a witch named llewelppop (popplewell backwards) making fun of her?
Wednesday, January 7, 2015 at 9:37pm PST
aha that makes me very relieved :)
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 9:30pm PST
Haha don't worry I didn't starve. :)

Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:56pm PST
Hey lily I'm going to go eat dinner now. I'll talk to you later. :)
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:56pm PST
Lol nah. I think they just think the y's are repetitive? Haha I don't know
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:55pm PST
Lol I guess it's okay? I'm guess I'm not used to hearing it.
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:55pm PST
maybe bc they're insulted that you'd even think about another name?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:55pm PST
idk why they don't like it
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:55pm PST
hmmm
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:55pm PST

Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:52pm PST
aha that sounds weird tho
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:52pm PST
Haha so you will be Michelle Bhattacharjee. :)
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:51pm PST

Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:51pm PST

Johan? who's that?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:48pm PST
Hahah it's okay. And then Johan called me lily 󾌴󾌴
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:48pm PST
So I awkwardly said um my name's not megan.
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:48pm PST
this calls for some cussing at pranav but whatevs
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:48pm PST
Then I realized he meant me.
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:48pm PST
And I turned around because I didn't remember there was a megan in our class
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:47pm PST
And then he was like HI MEGAN
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:47pm PST
Lol actually I was passing by him on my way to my seat
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:47pm PST
I like your analogies though. :)
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:47pm PST
i looked up then
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:47pm PST
i think he bumped into you in the beginning of class?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:47pm PST
oh yeah
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:47pm PST
pranav called you megan?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:46pm PST
aha my analogies are terrible but thanx for the compliment :)
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:46pm PST
Oh yeahh today did you hear Pranav calling me megan?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:46pm PST
Oh really? He should learn to focus more tbh
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:45pm PST
Haha and they are the sheep. That's a really funny analogy. 󾌴
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:45pm PST
but he has the attention span of a goldfish
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:45pm PST
ogni's really smart tho
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:45pm PST
yeah, i'm like the shepherd who's supposed to herd them back to the group and make them do the work
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:44pm PST
Lol oh golding.
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:44pm PST
Yeah they are mean that way. :/ it's okay I understand I see them messing around way too much
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:44pm PST
but general politeness and the rules of society (lotf haha) prevent me
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:44pm PST
they're really frustrating though so i feel like cussing sometimes
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:43pm PST
also if i ever cussed in class, samyak and ogni would never let me live it down
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:43pm PST
wow
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:42pm PST
kind of? very
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:41pm PST
Yeah it's kind of embarrassing.
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:41pm PST
yeah i don't want to be in that position
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:41pm PST
Oh really? Haha it's okay I'm sure everyone forgot
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:41pm PST
aha ohhh
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:41pm PST
and decided to stop swearing
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:41pm PST
Yeah he did and mrs. Liu made him copy words from the chem text book. 󾌴󾌴
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:41pm PST
i was as red as a tomato
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:41pm PST
and basically everyone nearby noticed
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:41pm PST
and started laughing
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:40pm PST
aha then my friend pointed at the poster
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:40pm PST
oh samyak cussed in class? i don't remember that
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:40pm PST
Lol really? Then what happened?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:40pm PST
Ah I see. Yeah you don't want to be accidently cussing in class. Remember mrs. Liu and samyak?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:40pm PST
until i cussed under a library poster that said no swearing
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:40pm PST
i used to cuss a lot last year bc i had the mistaken belief it make me seem cool
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:39pm PST
or when my sister annoys me too much
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:39pm PST
only when i'm really passionate about something
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:39pm PST
not much
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:39pm PST
It's okay. You don't cuss much do you?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:39pm PST
Haha no. My grammar is like super bad tbh. 󾌴 and lol at first I was like what's half-a___? .-.
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:39pm PST
sorry for the cussing
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:38pm PST
i just half-a__ it
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:37pm PST
i mean look at your impeccable grammar
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:37pm PST
i think it's bc you try to be perf at whatever you do
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:37pm PST
ohhh i think gialdini said something about that last year?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:37pm PST
Ah yes. For some reason I'm that person who can't do anything while multitasking which is really bad. :/
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:36pm PST
multitasking i mean?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:36pm PST
i bet you've done that before
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:36pm PST
Lol I won't don't worry. I just thought that you would be really busy and I don't want to add onto that :P
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:34pm PST
pls don't leave *big sad puppy dog eyes that won't work on you*
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:34pm PST
and then leave for a long time
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:34pm PST
for some reason, i come on fb in spurts
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:33pm PST
i barely talk to you enough as it is
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:33pm PST
omg i don't want to ask that of you
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:33pm PST
Ah I see. It's okay. Do you want to talk later then? :)
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:33pm PST
sorry!
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:33pm PST
Ah I see and lol noo why would I be offended? :o
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:33pm PST
it's very difficult
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:33pm PST
at this very moment, i'm also talking to jessica and ashwini

Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:29pm PST
:I)
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:29pm PST
ik ik
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:29pm PST
Really omg lily that's so much work though. :O
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:29pm PST
but i love the classes that i want to tkae
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:29pm PST
i was actually planning on take all ap classes although i know it's suicide
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:28pm PST
oh you're going to take 3? reminds me of O.W.L.s from harry potter lol
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:28pm PST
How about you?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:27pm PST
I was thinking about it but I'm probably taking 3 ap classes already so I don't want to kill myself
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:26pm PST
i've heard many juniors take it
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:26pm PST
are you going to take ap psych next year?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:26pm PST
jk take whatever you want to
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:26pm PST
aha yeah this is why you should take it ;) ;) so you can actually be in on our stuff
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:24pm PST
It's okay. And lol no it's okay. I mean I've always hear people taking engineering and digital electronics but I never knew what was going on in the class.
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:23pm PST
anyway, i'm not going to keep talking about this bc it's very boring to you i think
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:22pm PST
like math but without the calculations... if you get what i mean?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:22pm PST
and theoretical
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:22pm PST
anyway, digital electronics is very logical
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:22pm PST
yeah see i knew you'd like it :)
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:22pm PST
oh did i? ok i must have forgotten. sorry for repeating myself!
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:22pm PST
OHH I see. Ooh yes I remember you showing me this before. Looks interesting.
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:21pm PST
^that's a logic circuit :)
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:20pm PST
 
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:20pm PST
so like we had this voting assignment where given the votes of four people (prez, vice prez, secretary, treasurer) the ultimate vote was determined
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:20pm PST
a logic circuit's basically a circuit that you build out of ics and resistors and leds and whatnot to satisfy a real life problem
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:18pm PST
Oh yeah ahah I remember you told me that. What exactly is a nor logic circuit?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:16pm PST
especially after i blew up like 2 leds
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:16pm PST
._. millard keeps track of how many ics i take
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:16pm PST
hahaha i have to or else i won't be able to build my Nor only logic circuit
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:15pm PST
Lol really? Are you going to bring them back tomorrow?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:13pm PST
it was pretty funny
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:13pm PST
i actually brought 4 NOR ics home by accident today in my sharpener
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:12pm PST
you will LOVE LOVE LOVE engineering
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:12pm PST
i'll stop gushing about him lol :)
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:12pm PST
oh well
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:12pm PST
yeah, he didn't really try sophomore year but he got really serious in junior & senior year
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:12pm PST
Ah I see. I've never really looked into engineering. :P
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:11pm PST
Oh really? Lol tbh, ap euro isn't even ap level lol
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:11pm PST
my fave subject
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:11pm PST
hmm idk maybe engineering
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:11pm PST
he self-studied them but i don't think he got 5s on all of them. he got like 1 three and mostly 5s and some 4s. he got the 3 in ap euro funnily enough
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:10pm PST
woahh. That's crazy. How did he survive?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:10pm PST
Ooh nice. What kind of professor do you want to be? And yeah I'll see if I have the time to take it. School is so much work though 󾌺
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:09pm PST
he took 16 aps back in high school
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:09pm PST
yes he is very smart
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:09pm PST
you?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:08pm PST
yeah, i want to maybe be a professor somewhere when i grow up, so i'll need a phd
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:08pm PST
Really? Woah he does sound like a smart guy. And haha okay. Are you planning to get a phd though?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:05pm PST
i could take it with you lol
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:05pm PST
so taking a gap year isn't so bad
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:05pm PST
he actually went on a tour of rome bc he was sponsored to learn history
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:05pm PST
he's a genius
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:05pm PST
he's taking bio & history double major @ duke
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:05pm PST
i know a guy who's done that actually
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:05pm PST
hmm interesting thought
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:03pm PST
Just a thought lol. Maybe not bc I should just continue school until after my masters degree at least lol
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:03pm PST
i'm just asking
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:03pm PST
i'm not being incredulous or sarcastic here
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:02pm PST
gap year? are you serious?
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:02pm PST
aha phew
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:02pm PST
And yeah. I was actually thinking of taking a gap year after high school
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:02pm PST
Haha yeah so it's not like an awkward staring contest. 󾌴
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:02pm PST
ahaha that's wishful thinking though
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:01pm PST
okay that is very relieving *sigh*
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:01pm PST
Haha yes. 1 year long would be great tbh
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 7:01pm PST
Um he's looking at his computer and I just usually stare at the paper
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 6:51pm PST
yes winter break should be 1 year long!!
Tuesday, January 6, 2015 at 6:50pm PST
aha oh thanks for reassuring me! although i'm still sort of panicking... so does riley stare creepily while you're saying your oral test thing?
Sunday, January 4, 2015 at 2:59pm PST
Ikr I'm so sad break is ending. Why can't it be 3 weeks. D; and I don't want to go to school at all lol so maybe a 1? 󾌴 I'm so lazy. How about you?
Sunday, January 4, 2015 at 2:58pm PST
Oh yes the oral test thingy is suppose to be really short. I had it last year and it took like 2 mins
Sunday, January 4, 2015 at 2:58pm PST
And I'm planning to bake an apple pie? I'm not sure yet.
Sunday, January 4, 2015 at 2:57pm PST
I actually haven't finished but I've started haha. Been caught up in a lot of stuff lately
Sunday, January 4, 2015 at 2:57pm PST
Ah I see. Staying up late is bad but we all do it haha. And yay good job for almost finishing :)
Saturday, January 3, 2015 at 10:33pm PST
on a scale of 1-10, how much do you want to go back to school? :) :)
Saturday, January 3, 2015 at 10:33pm PST
reminds me that winter break's ending :'( rip
Saturday, January 3, 2015 at 10:33pm PST
oh and for riley, he said that the oral presentation had to be 1-2 minutes long or something, right? I don't really remember how long it's supposed to be...
Saturday, January 3, 2015 at 10:32pm PST
what do you think you're going to cook this time? haha this time you should bring me a sample too jk
Saturday, January 3, 2015 at 10:32pm PST
oh did you finish that recipe book? I bet you already have!
Saturday, January 3, 2015 at 10:31pm PST
you remember i told you that i hadn't started on the world lit project? i actually have it almost finished - only have the 4 tprcastt analyses left :) :) so happy
Saturday, January 3, 2015 at 10:31pm PST
haha my only new year's resolution is to stop staying up so long at night (well, technically the morning)
Thursday, January 1, 2015 at 10:50pm PST
Happy new year! :) and um not really lol how about you?
Thursday, January 1, 2015 at 10:11pm PST
:) :) any new year's resolutions?
Thursday, January 1, 2015 at 10:11pm PST
OH and Happy New Year!
Thursday, January 1, 2015 at 10:10pm PST
yes, i was very busy too :( i wish i could have talked to you more
Thursday, January 1, 2015 at 10:10pm PST
aha thanks :D
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:52pm PST
Good luck on work and studying!
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:52pm PST
It's alright. And yeah I better start working because I'll be busy the next few days. I'll talk to you later hopefully :)
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:52pm PST
Same. Like break isn't even break anymore. It's more like trying to finish all the work.
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:52pm PST
my mom keeps telling me to study now, so hopefully, i'll get time to talk to you later?? i never have that much time anymore :(
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:51pm PST
Oh right. Ahh so much work. :'(
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:51pm PST
i'm going to prep today and tmrw. so much work :( there's an ap exam in may wow time passes so quickly
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:50pm PST
How about you?
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:50pm PST
Um kind of? I forgot a lot of stuff. Oops.
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:50pm PST
ahaha thanks
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:50pm PST
anyway, have you started prepping for the spanish oral final
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:50pm PST
You can do this lily :)
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:50pm PST
Awh it's okay. I'm sure you will get 100 :) but it's just that maybe you should start a bit earlier.
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:50pm PST
oh well
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:50pm PST
i'm probably going to get an 80 or something
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:49pm PST
i feel depressed now
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:49pm PST
ohhh :'(
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:49pm PST
Okay. I was really confused because I thought it was suppose to be a person or something.
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:48pm PST
Yeah I think so because the other lily did it and she said the ttprcast thingy takes forever.
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:48pm PST
i'm not completely sure though
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:48pm PST
oh for that i actually put third person objective
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:48pm PST
Hey lily I have a question. So one of the question is like from what point of view is Simon's death told from? What did you put? I'm really unsure. :/
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:48pm PST
oh the poetry's a lot of work? wow i can't find anything i'll finish on time. i'm taking digital electronics notes now
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:47pm PST
yeah she taught that during the last few minutes of the socratic seminar
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:47pm PST
And yeah I'm probably going to do cookbook for all of them.
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:46pm PST
It's okay the ir project isn't due till a little while. I heard the poetry thing is easy but a lot of work. But maybe she will grade easy?
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:46pm PST
Ah I see. I remember she taught is that I think? But I don't remember.
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:46pm PST
you're doing the cookbook right?
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:45pm PST
i'm going to do the poetry thing it seems easy...
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:45pm PST
:'(
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:45pm PST
oh i haven't even finished my world lit book yet
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:45pm PST
oh the deus ex machina is basically like the intervention of God, like such a sudden/abrupt/miraculous ending that it's unlikely that it would have happened without some kind of heavenly hand
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:45pm PST
I'm also trying to finish my ir project but idk if I can
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:45pm PST
Haha I'm not very diligent. :P but you on the other hand are. :)
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:44pm PST
WOW i'm finally for the first time diligenter than diligent michelle O_O
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:44pm PST
Yeah I think so. What is the deus ex machina? I forgot.
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:43pm PST
I actually haven't got to that part yet so I'll see later
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:43pm PST
but i think opinions are fine right?
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:43pm PST
and how i didn't like it much
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:43pm PST
i mentioned the deus ex machina
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:43pm PST
ahaha i bet you said it was a good ending just to make wilkie feel better :)
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:42pm PST
Haha really? Yeah the ending was kind of random tbh
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:42pm PST
*ended
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:42pm PST
on the last page, i basically insulted how golding end lotf
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:42pm PST
yeah i guess but i think my answers are too long
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:41pm PST
Really? Oh dang. But at least you are finished right?
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:41pm PST
i don't need to sleep
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:41pm PST
ahahhaa
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:41pm PST
and i was like
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:41pm PST
i actually finished the wilkie packet at 4:08 AM today
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:40pm PST
Oh yeah same. So much.
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:40pm PST
Okay I should watch it sometime.
Sunday, December 28, 2014 at 2:40pm PST

Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 4:44pm PST
And no I haven't yet. How was it?
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 4:43pm PST
I usually just watch sit coms like modern family and stuff like that
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 4:43pm PST
Really? Awh I see. It's okay at least it was just a dream. And yeah same. I get really bad nightmares too
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 4:26pm PST
ooh and i just watched interstellar today. have you?
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 4:26pm PST
so i hate horror tv shows
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 4:26pm PST
i woke up a couple of night in a row after nightmares about zombies chasing me :(
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 4:25pm PST
:) yes i know i tried watching walking dead but it was too scary for me
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 4:24pm PST
well that's great. at least i know i could be the only one thinking my eyes are too small
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:37am PST
Really? I didn't notice your eyes being too small. And ooh yeah I've heard of some of these tv shows. Tbh. I get scared of horror movies/shows so I can't watch American horror story and walking dead even though everyone's been obsessing over it.
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:36am PST
anyway, how come i can't like your prof pic? :(
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:35am PST
there's tons of stuff i can't think of right now
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:35am PST
Hannibal, House of Cards
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:34am PST
The Matrix, Sherlock, Torchwood

Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:32am PST
Haha thanks. And I like your new profile picture too. :) um yeah kinda I watched some of it. Sorry I'm like so slow watching tv shows. :(
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:31am PST
it actually turned out more than ok. btw, have you been doing your hw by watching doctor who? ;)
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:30am PST
Oh really? Tbh, I was really uncomfortable but apparently the picture turned out okay.
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:30am PST
you look so unawkward though
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:30am PST
ahahahah
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:30am PST
It was really awkward because I just wanted to stand next to Donald Duck but then it stared hugging me. ._.
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:29am PST
seriously? this is what happens after days of math and studying. i think my brain shut down :(
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:29am PST
Lool. It's Donald duck
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:29am PST

Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:28am PST
daffy duck?
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:28am PST

Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:28am PST
Yeah. I think it's pretty creative. And really? Haha you can go look at my profile picture. :P
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:27am PST
:(
Thursday, December 25, 2014 at 10:26am PST

Thursday, December 18, 2014 at 9:41pm PST
Wow they do sound really immature. And yeah. They should be more careful.
Thursday, December 18, 2014 at 7:49pm PST
it's a miracle they haven't been electrocuted yet

Thursday, December 18, 2014 at 6:07pm PST

Thursday, December 18, 2014 at 7:32am PST
Lily you are way too nice, you didn't really have to get me anything!
Thursday, December 18, 2014 at 7:30am PST
We called each other big Michelle and small Michelle. It's sorta weird but it worked since she was older than me and stuff lol
Thursday, December 18, 2014 at 7:30am PST
Haha yeah I'll talking with my parents and see if I should take ap comp sci. :P and lol every time you raise your hand for English, you always say something that's super smart and I'm like woah. :o lol
Thursday, December 18, 2014 at 12:50am PST
anyway, i got a christmas present for you! :) :) so after school friday at my locker or yours (whatevs, i'll just stalk you there) and i'll give it to you but ONLY ON FRIDAY yes i shall keep you waiting ;)

Thursday, December 18, 2014 at 12:47am PST
whaaaat? good at english? you must be mistaken. the only thing i am remotely good at and like is engineering. which is why you are going to take ap comp sci with me next year :) :)
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:31pm PST
I used to talk to Michelle man a lot and it was pretty interesting because we would have nice names for each other lol
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:30pm PST
You are both super smart and good at English. :) and haha yeah that would be awkward... But she is an incredibly nice like you!
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:28pm PST
awkwarddd
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:28pm PST
"Hi lily" "hi lily" "what do you think,Lily"
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:28pm PST
although a conversation btwn us would probs be pretty funny
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:28pm PST
i don't really know her that well
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:27pm PST
ahaaha you don't know how weird that was. well you probably do because there are other michelles right? also, the other lily is different from me, i think. she's better at english & discussions :(
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:26pm PST
Lol that's true. Meet new people. :D and remember that one time you were like "adding on to what lily said"
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:26pm PST
except i'm lily b and she's lily a
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:26pm PST
we're both lilys
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:25pm PST
haha @ lily
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:25pm PST
no, it's completely fine! i wasn't meaning that as an accusation, when you're mingling, you should do that with others bc we're always together in english :) :)
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:25pm PST
Yeah it was me, Thomas and lily
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:24pm PST
Ah I see sorry I would have been in your group but I had to talk to lily about something so I stayed there.
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:24pm PST
i saw you were doing it with thomas and someone else
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:23pm PST
yeah it was very awkward. i was mingling with maydha and nariyah and i haven't talked to maydha in a month or somethign so yeah
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:22pm PST
Oh yeah same. And oh yeah lol the mingling was weird.
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:22pm PST
btw, you remember both of our groups in wilkie doing theme today?
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:21pm PST
i think we get to change it back after this spirit week. i'm not doing anything yet bc if i do, it'll look weird cause everyone else has that eagle and i'll stand out :(
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:21pm PST
And hah yeah. I don't know when we can change it back.
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:20pm PST
Awh maybe next year that you and her will be in the same classes. And Ooh yeah that would be good. :) this time you shall be in my lab group. :as
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:20pm PST
ahaha this chat is so weird we both have the same prof pics
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:19pm PST
I hope so! you know jessica really well, right? so we were hoping that we were in the same classes next year, but we weren't :( i think there's only 1 ap chem class though so maybe we'll both be in it? :)
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:18pm PST
And lol chem is actually really confusing to me but I don't know how I manage to get good grades. :P I hope we have the same class. :)
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:17pm PST
Haha no problem. I'm glad you like it. :D and yeah. It sucks that I lost my combos so I'm going to change all my locks just to be safe. Sigh $20 down the drain. :(
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:07pm PST
and of course you're going to take ap chem, you're so smart but you barely ever acknowledge it!
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:06pm PST
btw, i'm so sorry about you losing your locker combos :( if you need any help finding them or for anything, you can ask me, although i'm sure you have others to ask as well
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:05pm PST
back to plotting
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:05pm PST
i'm going to get you something really good too (other than the drawing, if you still want it) but you're going to get it on friday :)
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:04pm PST
it's interesting that you remembered i liked musketeers
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:04pm PST
wow now i feel the need to outperform you
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:04pm PST
Words cannot express how thoughtful I thought your gift was :) ty ty ty ty ty :)
Monday, December 15, 2014 at 8:03pm PST
MISHAAAAA :) :)
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 10:07pm PST
Haha actually I'm really bad at chem. :P and no there isn't thankfully!
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 10:06pm PST
there aren't any discussion/post lab questions for the lab, right? sorry for bothering you so much!
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 10:05pm PST
and you will take ap chem! you're good at chem already
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 10:05pm PST
so true, my dig electronics teacher always says that
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 6:27pm PST
And yeah. :) hopefully I take ap chem. I don't know yet.
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 6:27pm PST
Yeah. :/ I think she said this will be our lab groups for the rest of the year. I think she should change it every quarter because it's good to meet/work with new people right?
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 6:09pm PST
haha i wish i could sit next to you though. it looks like she's not going to change lab groups this year. :( maybe next year in ap chem?
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 6:07pm PST
Lol no problem. I sit near her so I'll catch the little things.
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 6:07pm PST
:) :)
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 6:07pm PST
you're so responsible. i never hear that stuff for some reason
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 6:06pm PST
oh thanks so much! I was really nervous for a moment
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 6:06pm PST
Mrs. Liu said we don't need to calculate that.
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 6:05pm PST
hey michelle, i just have a question. for the chem lab, did we have to get a class average and standard deviation? if we did, i don't remember them. do you have them?
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 5:27pm PST
Aha okay thanks. :) I'll give you the chocolate tomorrow then?
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 5:27pm PST
Awh good luck! And same all the teachers are cramming everything this week.
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 5:05pm PST
i don't need chocolate, but you're so nice for thinking about it :) and yes i am going to finish your drawing and give it to you this friday. yay early christmas presents! :) :)
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 5:04pm PST
haha @chocolate are you being serious?
Sunday, December 14, 2014 at 5:03pm PST

Saturday, December 13, 2014 at 9:36pm PST
Lillyyy hi :) do you want the chocolate on Monday? :)
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 11:11pm PST
That's okay. Yeah same. Teachers have been giving us so much hw and tests lately. It's ridiculous. Hopefully we can talk more during winter break though. :) one more week to go!
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 11:10pm PST
#sobusy
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 11:10pm PST
Sorry for being so curt! i never get a chance to talk to you anymore :'(
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 11:07pm PST
Okay see you in English. Good night :)
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 11:06pm PST

Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 11:06pm PST

Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 11:06pm PST
yeah hopefully :)
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 11:06pm PST
I don't think so. Maybe we have to turn it in Monday?
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 11:03pm PST
oh haha i didn't do it. i don't think she expects us to turn that in during break, right?
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 10:56pm PST
Yeah, just in case. Haha my attempts of trying to be diligent. 󾌴
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 10:55pm PST
i bet you finished it though, right?
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 10:55pm PST
Um I'm not sure. I don't think so. Because she can't expect us to right?
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 10:54pm PST
Hey lily :) and yes that I correct
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 10:54pm PST
so does that mean we still have to turn in the lab report for chem?
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 10:54pm PST
tomorrow's block day, right?
Thursday, December 11, 2014 at 10:54pm PST
hey mishaaa :)
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:56pm PST

Lol I use the emoji thing that's on my phone.
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:55pm PST

Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:55pm PST

Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:53pm PST
Oh yes. Gialdini is the boss. And extremely scary too. Omg your nickname for wilkinson. 󾌴󾌴󾌴
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:52pm PST
:)
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:52pm PST
not even wilkie
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:52pm PST
misha no one can be compared to the great dictator gialdini
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:52pm PST
That's true. She probably has very high expectations. Like gialdini. Ewh.
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:51pm PST
hahaaaaa ^^
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:51pm PST
:(
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:51pm PST
wilkinson's actually not easily impressed though
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:51pm PST
OHH yeah. Haha. That was really weird but seemed so accurate though.
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:51pm PST
lolllllll
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:51pm PST
he was like miley's name is destiny and beyonce is from destiny's child so beyonce is miley's daughter
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:50pm PST
remember the miley cyrus one?
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:50pm PST
i was laughing like no tomorrow
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:48pm PST
Lol wilkinson will be so proud of our essay skills. 󾮗
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:47pm PST
Yeah. People giggle at his jokes
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:47pm PST
Ikr. Hopefully we get to meet Ryan someday
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:47pm PST
yes, maybe we should write an essay to convince wilkinson
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:47pm PST
but not like laugh out loud funny
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:47pm PST
riley is sort of funny
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:46pm PST
YAS another thing we have in common. back when i was in india this summer, i was binge-watching ryan higa :) he's so funny and makes so many connections
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:46pm PST
Ryan higa did this really funny video on YouTube about the illuminati conspiracy. It's hilarious.
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:45pm PST
Omg I've heard so much about the illuminati and I'm like what going on. Am I missing out on something?
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:45pm PST
Haha Riley catch phrases
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:44pm PST
Awh. We should convince her to let us stay where we sit or something. I stil don't know how I feel about the desk arrangements. Kind of weird
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:44pm PST
#illuminati
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:44pm PST
i thought it was a huge conspiracy
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:44pm PST
yeah that was the first time i got spammed
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:43pm PST
Casi? Un minuto mas. lololol
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:43pm PST
exactly :) yes, i hope so too! but wilkinson is probs gonna move us b/c of meeting new people or such rot
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:41pm PST
Ohh yeah. I kept getting so many notifications about that lol
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:41pm PST
And oh yes. Riley is so boring and he tries too hard to be funny.
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:40pm PST
Awh thanks me too. :) I'm so glad we got to sit next to each other again. I hope we do for the whole year.
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:38pm PST
btw, do you remember back when people kept asking each other to play who miss you the most
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:38pm PST
riley's worse though
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:38pm PST
noooooo i almost fall asleep in english. The only reason i like it is b/c i see you there :) <3
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:36pm PST
Ikr it will be.
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:36pm PST
Yeah. It's 2,4,6 which means we have wilkinson. 󾌺
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:36pm PST
everything's gonna be so confusing when we get back
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:36pm PST
weird, i never heard that
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:35pm PST
what really?
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:34pm PST
Haha. I sometimes say that actually. And lol I cram a lot of stuff too. Apparently Friday is going to be a block day?
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:33pm PST
lol
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:33pm PST
and then cram everything at midnight
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:33pm PST
i'm going to wake up at 6:00 in the evening tmrw
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:33pm PST
haha you're not saying "ssa" spelled backwards so nice :)
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:32pm PST
Ikr. Sleeping in for sure.
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:32pm PST
Nooo. 󾌡 I didn't really like Antigone and that essay was a pain in the butt.
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:32pm PST
YAS no school
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:32pm PST
wow at this rate she's going to lost the assignment and make us redo it or something
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:31pm PST
then it was after thanksgiving break
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:31pm PST
yes and before that she was like "I'll give it back before thanksgiving break"
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:30pm PST
No school tomorrow I'm so happy.
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:30pm PST
LILYYY :)
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:30pm PST
Yeah same. I heard she said she will give it back next Tuesday but watch her give it back by senior year lol
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:29pm PST
MISHAAAAAAAAA! :)
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:18pm PST
yes, it's taking her FOREVER to grade the essays. It's so annoying b/c if I did badly, I want the chance to at least get a little better
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:17pm PST
ahaha I like it when Wilkinson is gone too b/c sometimes we have fun subs
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 3:43pm PST
I hear she hasn't even finished grading our essays either. -_-
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 3:43pm PST
Hm. I don't feel very excited lol. I like it when she's gone. Is that really mean to say?
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 3:42pm PST
Lol yeah I guess. Most people probably understand the feeling too so hopefully they won't judge. :P and yeah that trick never works
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 11:34pm PST
idk if i'm excited or unexcited if that's a word
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 11:33pm PST
anyway... wilkinson's coming back tmrw
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 11:33pm PST
btw never think of people in their underwear that trick never works it just distracts people
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 11:33pm PST
don't worry :) if you're ever nervous, remember that half the class is probably chewing their nails off (something I do when I'm nervous) and i'm having a mini heart attack
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 8:31pm PST
Lol I still get super nervous while talking infront of the class.
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 5:51pm PST
yes i am so good :)
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 5:51pm PST
you can't possibly hate public speaking more than i do
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 4:42pm PST
Lol homework. And spiders. Wow you are so good. Guessed correctly. And also public speaking
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 4:40pm PST
:)
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 4:40pm PST
jk
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 4:40pm PST
Or.. what are you scared of?
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 4:39pm PST
I can draw you homework. Or spiders
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 4:39pm PST
sure! I'll draw you something
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 4:39pm PST
aha finally you have given into your baser instincts (mind over matter ~ remember Peffer) :)
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 4:38pm PST
Lol oh no. I loath hw. And hm. Is a small drawing from you too much to ask? I really like your drawings. :)
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 4:36pm PST
especially during winter break
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 4:36pm PST
Or else I'll tell wilkinson and liu you love getting hw
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 4:35pm PST
What?? I knew you'd be too polite. Come on... spill! :)
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 3:59pm PST
Lol it's okay. You don't have to give me anything. :)
Monday, December 8, 2014 at 10:40pm PST
omg you don't have too but thanks :) :) what would you like for christmas then? And don't be too nice, just say it :)
Monday, December 8, 2014 at 10:19pm PST
Ah I see. Hm okay maybe I'll check it out. And I'm going to get that candy bar for you for Christmas. :)
Monday, December 8, 2014 at 9:59pm PST
nooooo now i can't get your dream present for you :'(
Monday, December 8, 2014 at 9:58pm PST
haha nah it's fine
Monday, December 8, 2014 at 9:58pm PST
Yes the Foundation series is absolutely amazing :) but only if you like hard sci-fi
Sunday, December 7, 2014 at 11:27pm PST

Tuesday, November 25, 2014 at 11:17pm PST

Tuesday, November 25, 2014 at 11:16pm PST

Tuesday, November 25, 2014 at 11:08pm PST
Lily so diligent. 󾮗 and ah I see. That's good. Facebook can be very addictive at times.

Okay. Haha it looks like I have a lot of catching up to do. And ooh yeah. My friend showed me the first episode of Sherlock before.
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:42pm PST

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:42pm PST

Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:42pm PST
My goal this year is to educate you in popular sci-fi/fantasy tv shows
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:42pm PST
I <3 weeping angels. Once you watch "Blink" I swear you're never going to look at a statue the same way again. Also, start watching Supernatural.
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:41pm PST
Haha okay. They sound very intriguing and they have a very cool name.
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:40pm PST
the coolest villains ever ^
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:40pm PST
:) :) :) Just wait until you get to the Weeping Angels
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:40pm PST
It's pretty interesting so far. :)
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:39pm PST
I think so.
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:39pm PST
You're on the episode with the mannequins right?
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:39pm PST
You're on the right one!
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:38pm PST
yesyesyes
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:38pm PST
Umm. I think her name is rose? And really? I've never heard of it. Is it good?
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:38pm PST
btw I started watching house of cards :D
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:38pm PST
I'm just trying to get on the same page as you
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:37pm PST
Clarification: Who's the Doctor's companion from the episode you watched?
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:37pm PST
Umm. I just watched a bit of the first episode of season 1. I should watch everything before I go on to season 8 right? Because I feel so behind lol.
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:35pm PST
Wait--- so you're watching the 9th doctor (Christopher Eccleston)
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:35pm PST
Lol yeah. I was going to start watching it over this weekend but I ran out of time. And actually I'm on this other website but it has episodes from seasons 1-7 and season 8 too
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:34pm PST
Wait, you're on netflix, right?
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:34pm PST
You're finally watching doctor who!
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:33pm PST
YASSSS
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:33pm PST
Oh yeah, I've decided to start watching doctor who. :) should I start from season 1? Or just watch the beginning of season 8?
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:32pm PST
Heyy lily :) yes we haven't talked in forever. Sorry I've just been so busy lately. And really? Oh no is your dad going to get you some more soon?
Wednesday, November 12, 2014 at 10:31pm PST

Thursday, November 6, 2014 at 8:35pm PST
yeah. ive gotten hacked before. did you just get hacked? :O
Thursday, November 6, 2014 at 8:34pm PST
Do people sometimes get hacked on facebook?
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:31pm PST
Aha okay. Well I really have to go now. I'll talk to you later and see you tomorrow. Byeee :)
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:30pm PST
Haha. It sounds really weird. But I shall be a ninja nonetheless :)
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:30pm PST
hahhaaa doesn't fit too well
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:29pm PST
Ninjachelle
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:28pm PST
I'll maybe come over sneakily or something. Like a ninja. Lol.
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:27pm PST
Yeah suree. I hope Liu doesn't mind because I remember one time she was yelling at someone because they were not with their group even though they finished their lab. :(
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:26pm PST
next time i do a lab, can you come hang out once you're done?
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:26pm PST
it's just that liu's so close by
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:26pm PST
actually i'll go to you if i can
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:26pm PST
And haha yeah. It was pretty cheesy. But funny.
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:25pm PST
Hm I see. It's okay. I shall go to you sometime so you won't always have to stick with him.
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:25pm PST
btw, the hydrogen and oxygen joke he made was sort of cheesy :)
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:24pm PST
see ya michelle
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:24pm PST
oh well i guess i have to put up with him for the rest of the year
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:22pm PST
idk he's usually quieter. most of the time pretty annoying though. sometimes, i can't tell if he's trying to imply something or if he's being his normal self
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:21pm PST
Working with you in chem today was awesome. Although samyak kept on bothering you lol. Is it usually like that?
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:20pm PST
It's okay me too. I'm trying to study for the test right now. See you tomorrow then! And yeah. I'm so glad we do. :)
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:19pm PST
btw I just realized we see each other every day of the week! :)
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:19pm PST
oh ok. sorry for my lackluster response. I need to finish the journal :p see you tomorrow
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:18pm PST
I used the laughing emoji. Lol maybe it doesn't show on the web. :P and okay. I shall call you liltalker then.
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:17pm PST
and yessss I shall call you that until the end of time
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:17pm PST
what is the emoticon you just used?
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:16pm PST
Haha are those our nicknames now? 󾌴
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:15pm PST
Michelistening and Liltalker
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:13pm PST
Ah I see. I like listening to people though. :) and yess you do. I might start watching it this weekend since it's a 4 day weekend yay.
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:12pm PST
you're such a good listener that I just keep talking and you don't talk about yourself! Anyway, I need to educate you on doctor who and stuff
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:12pm PST
Yeah that would be a good idea. I did up to 17 and it took like forever. :(
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:11pm PST
And lol what do you mean by talking about myself?
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:11pm PST
I'll do some tonight though
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:11pm PST
haha i didn't do anything so far or for peffer other than the first 6
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:11pm PST
Aha it's okay. I procrastinate a lot too. For the Riley wb pages, I just bs it because I know he only checks for completeness not if it's correct
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:10pm PST
michelle, talk about yourself this time
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:09pm PST
i am such a procrastinator
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:09pm PST
oh well, I'm doing my journal now :) I suppose I'll worry about the seminar tomorrow when i'm also trying to finish the riley wb pages
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:08pm PST
Yeah. That's really scary.
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:08pm PST
It's okay. I'm sure you will be fine. :) I just hope she doesn't expect us to talk a lot since it's 1 hour for two groups.
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:08pm PST
I heard your grade can go down to a d if you don't participate though
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:07pm PST
I'm not going to prepare. I'm going to failll
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:06pm PST
Yeah. :( and me too. Why does she have to do this to us. And on such a short notice too
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:06pm PST
I hate socratic seminars. with a vengeance
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:05pm PST
are you being serious?
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:05pm PST
oh ___
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:05pm PST
Haha thanks. And yeah she isn't stamping it since she is going to collect it on Friday anyways. By the way, my friend told me we have a Socratic seminar on Friday. :(
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:03pm PST
^wall of text
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:03pm PST
Great, thanks a lot! Just checking with the most responsible person I know ;) also, wilkinson isn't stamping journals tomorrow right? I was thinking I wanted to add more to mine, but sometime when I wasn't so tired
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:02pm PST
No problem :)
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:02pm PST
Hey lily yeah the Spanish workbook is due Friday.
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:01pm PST
Thanks! :)
Wednesday, November 5, 2014 at 10:01pm PST
Hey Michelle, the spanish workbook is due Friday right?
Monday, November 3, 2014 at 4:27pm PST
And haha it's okay. I was just about to start homework. How about you?
Monday, November 3, 2014 at 4:27pm PST
Yay that's good. :) yeah honestly, tests are more important than project anyways
Monday, November 3, 2014 at 3:38pm PST
my entire worldview has been destroyed... anyway, what are you doing right now? I keep talking about me (so self-centered) that I forget to ask about you sometimes :(
Monday, November 3, 2014 at 3:37pm PST
they just want me to do well on tests o_o
Monday, November 3, 2014 at 3:37pm PST
speaking of asian parents, my parents actually didn't explode about the mole project
Monday, November 3, 2014 at 3:37pm PST
you don't need to apologize for sleeping! :) proof that you are way too nice for your own good
Sunday, November 2, 2014 at 12:39pm PST
Oops sorry I was sleeping. And haha yeah totally what an Asian parent would do. Such high standards.
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:53pm PDT
anyway goodnight! :)
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:51pm PDT
Asian parent: You must go to MIT and find the cure for cancer as well
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:50pm PDT
Asian parent: No children you must prepare for the SAT and get 2400 or else you shall be disowned
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:48pm PDT
Aha oh god. The SAT haunts me.
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:48pm PDT
Night!
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:48pm PDT
Asian parent: 12?! Be diligent and study for SAT children
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:48pm PDT
Night!
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:47pm PDT
We are such good children. Going to sleep before 12 󾮗
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:47pm PDT
SEE YOU GOOD NIGHT
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:47pm PDT
hahah thanks. I'll be going to bed too
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:46pm PDT
Hey lily I'm kinda of sleepy right now so I think I'll go to sleep. I'll talk to you later. Good night :)
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:46pm PDT
Yess you are super super smart.
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:46pm PDT
Haha yes. We can be expelled and find some other things to blow up. :)
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:45pm PDT
yes, i remember!
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:45pm PDT
ahaha no I'm not that smart. give the stickers to matt or someone
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:45pm PDT
I remember in elementary when I would do good on a test, my teacher would put a sticker on my paper. It would be quite satisfying.
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:45pm PDT
jk but if you blow up the classroom, I'll blow it up with you :) and we can be expelled together
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:44pm PDT
I think you deserve a "great" and a whole bunch of gold stars. :) or like stickers in general.
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:43pm PDT
Nahhh you'll be fine. psst I think Liu already knows my evil motives. She never puts "great" on my test papers. :(
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:42pm PDT
But I feel like I would be the person to accidentally blow up the classroom since I'm so clumsy and I knock stuff over. :P so I have to be super careful
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:41pm PDT
Lol probably. Chem is so dangerous but so fun mixing different things and seeing different reactions happening.
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:39pm PDT
I like mixing and exploding things. If I told Liu, she wouldn't have accepted me in hrs chem. Just wait until I blow up the table and set off the smoke alarm. She's going to go ballistic :)
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:38pm PDT
Same here. Don't want to have a bad record. And really? Haha how?
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:37pm PDT
because of me
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:37pm PDT
If I wasn't so concerned about that, the school would have exploded by now
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:37pm PDT
yup. although I think I'm still at Level 4. I'm too afraid to break the rules and get in trouble b/c I want to get into an ok good university
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:36pm PDT
Yes. Must follow to rules to not get in trouble. Hm this reminds me of kolhberg's theory of morality for some reason?
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:35pm PDT
:)
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:34pm PDT
that actually could apply to me. I've got to be careful
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:34pm PDT
hahaha although Foreman got fired for not following rules :)
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:33pm PDT
Ohh. Lily you are such a bad girl. Lol just kidding. :) and ah I see. Yeah I think his personality is like yours.
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:32pm PDT
Foreman's sort of a results person. He's not afraid to say what he thinks most of the time, although he can be a little bit officious
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:31pm PDT
I've violated 6 :)
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:30pm PDT
What is he like?
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:30pm PDT
Oh no! I have violated one of the 7 deadly sins. :o *hangs head in shame*
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:29pm PDT
I'm most like Foreman I guess. You should really watch the show tho
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:29pm PDT
SLOTH jk :)
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:29pm PDT
And oopsie. Sorry. I was too lazy to type out doctor. Which shows how lazy of a person I am. 󾌴
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:28pm PDT
Which character are you most like on the show?
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:28pm PDT
Yes, I am raving about your niceness
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:28pm PDT
it's fine
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:28pm PDT
Hahaha oh no, how darest thou say dr. Who. It's DOCTOR WHO jk
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:26pm PDT
Lol he sounds like an interesting character. I should really start watching dr. Who. And aha yeah. I do get called nice a lot. :P
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:16pm PDT
wow such a wall of text
Saturday, November 1, 2014 at 11:16pm PDT
Wilson is really smart plus he's the nicest character on the show. I'm sure you get called nice very often though. Wilson's sort of like House's conscience and he's really too angelic to be realistic. He's perfect except for the fact that he's been divorced too many times. Not that that has anything to do with you... just the niceness :)
Friday, October 31, 2014 at 6:37pm PDT
Really? What is Wilson like? :o and it's okay haha I love emoticons. Okay bye for now!
Friday, October 31, 2014 at 5:48pm PDT
^W
Friday, October 31, 2014 at 5:48pm PDT
BYE FOR NOw
Friday, October 31, 2014 at 5:48pm PDT
No, I am not on Mentos :( and for some reason I am using way too many emoticons
Friday, October 31, 2014 at 5:48pm PDT
You remember House MD, the tv show I asked you about today? You remind me so much of Wilson :)
Friday, October 31, 2014 at 5:47pm PDT
Anyway Michelle, thanks for putting up with my insanity :)
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:15pm PDT
If you really want to know why they are not replying, maybe you can ask them if you see them in person?
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:14pm PDT
Lol okay. It's fine. I'm so glad we get to talk though :) and lol nope I haven't studied yet. Currently doing my journal. And no problem, so glad to help. If you need anyone to talk to any time, I'll be here :)
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:13pm PDT
:) thanks for trying to cheer me up :)
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:13pm PDT
Ok wait, my mom keeps yelling at me to eat dinner. I'll be back in a few. Sorry for starting conversations and not finishing them. I promise I'll be all peppy and hyper on Mentos by the time I get back! By the way, have you reviewed for Peffer yet? ^yes, I suppose. I'll cut them some slack, I guess
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:12pm PDT
Or maybe it is because they are busy or something?
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:12pm PDT
Awh I see. Well maybe they aren't trying to ignore you. This situation has actually happened to me before and I asked the person and they told me they didn't even seen a notification.
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:11pm PDT
Nope, it doesn't even say "seen." It's actually getting depressing to the point of me wanting to troll them just to get them to notice me. He/She's actually online right now
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:10pm PDT
It's okay. And umm what do you mean? Like does it say "seen at 9:30" for example. And they don't reply?
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:09pm PDT
I'm just very frustrated
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:08pm PDT
Sorry for ranting to you
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:08pm PDT
Wow you are so cheerful. Question: what do you do if someone doesn't 'see' your messages? It's almost like I'm invisible (not talking about you)
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:07pm PDT
Awh don't be sad
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:07pm PDT
Heyy lily!
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:07pm PDT
Hi Michelle
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 9:06pm PDT
:(
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 3:58pm PDT
And omg. Yesss. We shall all go hyper when we eat the mentos haha.
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 3:58pm PDT
And really? Awh I see. It's okay. Is it because if the participation or is it because of the test? If you don't mind me asking. By the way, thank you for trying to make me feel better after I got my journal. I really appreciate it. :)
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 3:57pm PDT
Lol it's okay, I didn't even notice you acted awkward. :)
Thursday, October 30, 2014 at 3:32pm PDT
One thing I'm really bad at is empathizing with people (like Prince Prospero). So if I acted really awkwardly in class today, I'm sorry! By the way, I did terribly on the first Riley test and I have a B+ now :( and I have a low A in math, if that makes you feel any better. We all have bad luck sometimes... Enough with the mushy moment! HI MICHELLE I AM CONTEMPLATING BRINGING MENTOS TO SCHOOL TOMORROW
Wednesday, October 29, 2014 at 4:37pm PDT
Lol actually I kind of get hyper from eating too much candy too. And yeah. It's really awkward meditating in front of everyone
Wednesday, October 29, 2014 at 4:28pm PDT
although wilkinson gives more work than creger... I don't want to have to meditate in class
Wednesday, October 29, 2014 at 4:27pm PDT
Yeah, for some reason, mentos make me more hyper than anything. I don't think anything can make you hyper though :)
Wednesday, October 29, 2014 at 4:05pm PDT
And yes I agree. Wilkinson is so much better than Stewart.
Wednesday, October 29, 2014 at 4:05pm PDT
Haha hey lily :) do the mentos make you very hyper?
Wednesday, October 29, 2014 at 3:52pm PDT
Oh yeah... HI MICHELLEEEE
Wednesday, October 29, 2014 at 3:51pm PDT
I'm on mentos again. I am very random
Wednesday, October 29, 2014 at 3:51pm PDT
I just figured out that I am very lucky to be in wilkinson's class and not stewart's :)
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 11:07pm PDT
Okay. Byeee see you in wilkinson on Thursday! :)
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 11:05pm PDT
#long
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 11:05pm PDT
He was pretty creepy and I totally agree with you on Mayella! But they were both sort of funny. I don't know, I find everyone funny. Anyway, my dad's yelling at me to get off the computer. Bye Michelle! See ya in Wilkinson on Thursday!
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 11:04pm PDT
Lol yeah I guess so. His comments were so ridiculously funny.
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 11:04pm PDT
Haha really? I thought he was pretty creepy. And mayella was totally a drama queen.
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 11:03pm PDT
He was kind of funny in a racist way, and he added some humor (b/c I was laughing at him the whole time)
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 11:03pm PDT
To be honest, I liked Bob Ewell because he was a crazy lunatic.
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 11:01pm PDT
Hmm. Honestly, I don't really have a favorite. But if I had to choose... Maybe Jem? How about you?
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 11:00pm PDT
Yeah. Who was your favorite character from To Kill a Mockingbird (don't you dare say Atticus :) )?
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 11:00pm PDT
Me too. They were more straight forward so we didn't have to guess what the author meant.
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 10:59pm PDT
It's so difficult... oh well. I don't know, for some reason, I liked the freshman books better like TKAM and Of Mice and Men
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 10:57pm PDT
Same. I don't know how she expects us to write two paragraphs about it.
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 10:57pm PDT
I'm going to stay up until 12 tomorrow doing it
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 10:57pm PDT
Nope. I'm such a procrastinator. :)
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 10:56pm PDT
No not yet. I'm kinda having trouble finding the symbolism of stuff and connecting it all together. Have you done it yet?
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 10:55pm PDT
Yes. Also, on a completely different subject, did you finish the wilkinson journal yet?
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 10:54pm PDT
Yeahh. Soarin' is so fun. It's one of my favorites.
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 10:54pm PDT
Really? Awh I see. And when did you go? I agree, Epcot was amazing. Got to experience all the countries in one place. :)
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 10:52pm PDT
^that was long
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 10:51pm PDT
Yes! A fellow Mentos fan! Unfortunately, my dad only gives me a strict regimen of once a day will probably notice me trying to sneak some out :( Oh yeah, I went to Disneyworld (did I mention that already?) Epcot was amazing. Did you ride soarin'?
Tuesday, October 28, 2014 at 10:50pm PDT

Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:20pm PDT
Yesss. To be honest, you are literally one of the nicest people I know.
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:19pm PDT
Haha am I actually nice? The test said I was south, but after west & north :)
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:17pm PDT
Really? Lol that's not true. I think you have some south in you too. If that makes sense.
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:16pm PDT
You are south b/c you don't say no or get mad. How can you not get mad? For me, mad is a natural state of being. Right next to really insane
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:16pm PDT
Lol thank you. What did you get again?
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:15pm PDT
yeah

Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:15pm PDT
don't worry that was a compliment
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:15pm PDT
I can understand why you got south on that direction test
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:14pm PDT
Haha okay.

yes. anyway, can I talk to you in like 10 min? I'm on the last 2 problems and I just want to get them done quickly. Then, I shall talk to you. Sorry, I just don't want them to drag one foreverrr
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:12pm PDT
Ah yeah I studied until pretty late too. It's always a good idea to study for a chem test especially. And really? But it's good that there aren't so many problems. :P
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:11pm PDT
so boring
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:11pm PDT
anyway, i'm doing chem hw now
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:09pm PDT
Thats why I was so surprised. I'm very lucky sometimes
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:09pm PDT
It'll always be hard if we don't study. Last time I didn't study until the night before. Stayed up until 12 cramming.
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 8:08pm PDT
Lol nah I don't think so. But hopefully it's not too hard.
Monday, October 27, 2014 at 7:18pm PDT
Hahaa gracias. But you are going to get a higher score than me on the next one, I bet!

Alright good luck! And yeah me too. I was just about to study for the chem test. So scared. D;
Sunday, October 19, 2014 at 10:14pm PDT
:) Anyway, I'm going to go finish a math poster (procrastinator alert) so see you tomorrow. I wish I could talk to you more though
Sunday, October 19, 2014 at 10:13pm PDT

Hi again Michelle :) So... did you finish Journal 10? I know it's late, and it's ok, but still...
Wednesday, October 15, 2014 at 6:59pm PDT
Okay see you then!
Wednesday, October 15, 2014 at 6:59pm PDT

Wednesday, October 15, 2014 at 6:58pm PDT
Thanks so much!
Wednesday, October 15, 2014 at 6:58pm PDT
I'm sorry for making you look Michelle! Thanks a lot for helping! I finally found the peer review sheet in my binder. What a wild goose chase. This is a warning that I need to be more organized.
Wednesday, October 15, 2014 at 6:53pm PDT
Hey lily sorry I don't seem to have your peer edit sheet. :/ hmm did you accidentally give it to someone or is it in one of your binders?
Wednesday, October 15, 2014 at 6:51pm PDT
Hey Michelle, do you happen to have my peer review sheet or do you remember even vaguely where I might have put it? I can't find it now :( Thanks for your help (advance) anyway!

Mhm. No problem.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:16pm PST
Oh, ok! I thought lab pitch meant that we had to pitch or sell the idea of the lab to the other officers/the club. Thanks for clarifying.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:14pm PST
We usually pitch ideas. We get to working out what to do after we agree on what to do.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:14pm PST
Ok, I'm going to have to leave now, so I guess we can talk about this tomorrow? If a lab pitch includes a demo, do we have to talk to Liu about materials? And, we do need a procedure, right?
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:11pm PST
Oh, hm, I got the idea from looking at this lab which was about the identification of an unknown aqueous solution by causing it to crystallize at low temps. We can look into it. What do you think about an identify-this lab? Would it be too long/boring?
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:09pm PST
The crystallization thing.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:09pm PST
The first one I said, or...?
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:08pm PST
That first one could be fun to mess with, actually.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:08pm PST
Sorry, I don't think I'm getting exactly what you're talking about.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:08pm PST
or low temperature labs relating to the functioning of glow sticks?
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:05pm PST
Oh, here's an idea: we can do something related to crystallization? I mean, that would relate very tangentially to the storms you were talking about and also connect to super/saturated/unsaturated solutions
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:02pm PST
Well, there's all sorts of stuff that you can do with making things really cold.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:02pm PST
are you thinking about incorporating meteorology?
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:02pm PST
Hmm, so you'd like to do something related to thermodynamics...? How are you thinking about relating a natural occurrence to chem?
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:00pm PST
Cause winter superstorms.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:00pm PST
Similar to some phenomena that's occuring in Eastern cities.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:59pm PST
Maybe something really cold. 
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:58pm PST
Not at the moment.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:58pm PST
Do you have any ideas?
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:58pm PST
Well, the lab is simple in principle. It just involves measuring the temperature of water as it is being heated/cooled frequently, but it does reveal something we're not taught in class.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:57pm PST
Hmmmm...... How would we make it a demo, though...
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:57pm PST
what do you think?
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
idk how interesting this would be though
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
like parabolas, except tapering off
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
but by using these chem principles and the basic ideas of calculus, we can actually show them to be curves
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
so in phase diagrams, the temperature change of water is shown as linear
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:55pm PST
we could do a lab that basically uses both to chart heating and cooling curves of water
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:55pm PST
So like because we're doing kinetics and just did thermodynamics in AP Chem
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:55pm PST
I kind of have an idea.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:55pm PST
Oh. I just noticed that.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:54pm PST
We're just trying to get people to sign up for an event at the moment.
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 9:44pm PST
For Chem Club, I noticed that we'll have to perform a lab pitch during the Friday meeting. Is this the p-nitroaniline, or something else, and can I help?
Monday, December 21, 2015 at 10:03am PST
Hm. We haven't gone that far yet. We're dealing with funding and safety for the moment.
Sunday, December 20, 2015 at 10:33pm PST
Okay. Thanks. The lab idea does sound really interesting. Are we also going to be measuring mole ratios of reagents or using other isomers of nitroaniline with 4-nitroaniline as the control?
Friday, December 18, 2015 at 3:52pm PST
And we're synthesizing a polymer using 4-nitroanilline. It'll be pretty cool if we could get it working.
Friday, December 18, 2015 at 3:52pm PST
Don't worry about it. Right now, we really just need to deal with funding it.
Friday, December 18, 2015 at 3:21pm PST
Do you need help with anything in relation to planning this lab? I apologize again for my neglect of officer duties. It won't happen again.
Friday, December 18, 2015 at 3:20pm PST
I am so sorry for not paying attention to what's going on in Chem Club, and I didn't notice this message until just now. I've been reading the previous messages and apparently, you're planning on synthesizing 4-nitroaniline?
Wednesday, December 16, 2015 at 6:55pm PST
Wellington says we need to come up with a lab to present during tomorrow's officer meeting.

Sunday, February 28, 2016 at 6:30pm PST

Sunday, February 28, 2016 at 6:30pm PST
Okay, thank you! So we're arguing that books are better than the adapted movies right?
Sunday, February 28, 2016 at 6:29pm PST
ya I kinda just said that we would argue together with set reasons
Sunday, February 28, 2016 at 6:28pm PST
in terms of who will be saying what, I'm fine with anything. maybe we could split up the argument by 1st person: introduction, reason #3 2nd person: reason #1, counterargument 3rd person: reason #4, conclusion?
Sunday, February 28, 2016 at 6:26pm PST
alright thanks
Sunday, February 28, 2016 at 6:24pm PST
for the question: we will include input from established movie critics that disparages the lack of adherence to book content to build the ethos of the argument as well as pathos in terms of how many moviegoers who have previously read the related book are disappointed by inconsistent or non-canon elements. Concessions that may be made include the fact that for artistic value and dramatic effect, it is reasonable that some alterations be made to novel adaptations and that sometimes, these changes may be endorsed by the writers themselves. This view on the topic may be introduced by initially providing an example of a famous/popular movie that was widely considered to be a flop despite the acclaim that its corresponding book received.
Sunday, February 28, 2016 at 5:35pm PST
 
Sunday, February 28, 2016 at 5:35pm PST
hey lily do you have any input for this question
Sunday, February 28, 2016 at 2:32pm PST
no the form hasn't been submitted and I think we're gonna change it to "movie adaptations are presented better than the original book" so that we can have a pro/con side and we would be the con, for books over movies
Sunday, February 28, 2016 at 2:15pm PST
Thanks! So we need to submit the form by 8:00, so are we pro or con on the book vs movie, or is the form already submitted? Sorry, I've kind of forgotten.

I tried doing calculations but I think they were wrong because I ended up with a constant ratio. By the way, I think we need an adjustable fulcrum.
Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 11:26pm PDT
Sure. I'll only be able to stay 3-4 though; I have a class afterward. I'll help you build the levers to the best of my ability. What do you think our calculations should look like and do you think the weight of the lever arms will play a role?
Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:49pm PDT
that's actually a lot better for us because that means less work for us since VEX materials are easier to work with
Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:48pm PDT
so i looked in the rule book and you arent allowed to add pulleys and other stuff to increase ima and ama or any other form of mechanical advantage

Hello. I'm one of the lab coordinators for Chem Club besides Matthew, and I think the officer chat said that we were supposed to pitch lab ideas on Friday, except we didn't. We had planned a couple of vague ideas just in case with a theme of crystallization and solubility mainly because they're tangentially related to recent winter storms. The notes that we talked over are present here, if you'd like to see them: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1icy5HRZXNOupD8mg1oaJMm765J1Kd7uaQ4Th9AaqnZU/edit?usp=sharing. Is there anything else we should do or look into? I know we were planning a p-nitroaniline lab that's supposed to be in the fundraising stage, but please let me know if there's anything specific that I should be doing. Thank you for taking the time to read this!

Wednesday, May 24, 2017 at 9:53pm PDT
hi adrian!! do you know by when we need to have our poster materials for the physics project checked off by licht?
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 2:02am PDT
also, last minute reminder, remember to hole punch the pages you print (23-43) :))
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:52am PDT
 
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:52am PDT
good luck on the presentation tmrw! i'll be sure to practice
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:52am PDT
:D
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:52am PDT
but i hope you get to go to sleep after this
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:52am PDT
haha i'm not tired :)
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:52am PDT
i'll do the poster as well. remember to bring a binder / folder if possible (idk if he will deduct)
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:52am PDT
Sure, i can do that
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:51am PDT
Sorry we are both quite tired
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:51am PDT
is it all right if you do the rest?
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:51am PDT
i'll print out pages 1-22 of the paper
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:51am PDT
 
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:51am PDT
Yeah! in terms of which slides we're doing, i'm for 2, 3, 11-17. you have the rest
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 12:42am PDT
Are we done?
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:28pm PDT
I'll be glad to help
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:28pm PDT
and thanks for putting up w/ me thru this project lol i probably wasn't very easy to deal with
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:27pm PDT
thanks i didn't notice that!
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:27pm PDT
:)
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:25pm PDT
That is why I am helping you in that regard
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:25pm PDT
 
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:25pm PDT
ugh the paper is taking forever
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:25pm PDT
ok so for the presentation, are you ok w/ me doing purpose, sampling method, and statistical analysis? then you'd have data, survey, and conclusion left. let me know if you want to switch any topics!
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:11pm PDT
 
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:10pm PDT
squeeze out every last drop of meaning from it
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:10pm PDT
and understand the data better
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:10pm PDT
the histograms are just additional data to fill up pages
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:09pm PDT
hmm that'll be low priority then. for the 6 histograms, you don't need to show them all on the powerpoint. honestly, the powerpoint & the poster should be summaries of the paper so i think only the test should be important
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:09pm PDT
What to do with six histograms?
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:08pm PDT
Not sure
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:08pm PDT
actually idk do we need a poster?
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:08pm PDT
 
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:08pm PDT
i'll show you a pic of the poster when we're done
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:08pm PDT
i don't think we need anything else
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:08pm PDT
if you can find a binder, i'll do the poster
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:08pm PDT
:) also in terms of printing out the final pages, i'm not sure how long you'll be up (i'll be up until at least 3) but when you wake up / when we're done, we can split printing in 1/2
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:06pm PDT
You too, although mine is filled with illustrations
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:05pm PDT
lol adrian no need to be so formal :)) but also before i forget good luck on the licht check in tmrw (honestly i'm panicking about that bc i still don't fully understand general relativity :'( )
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:03pm PDT
Your contributions are very appreciated
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:02pm PDT
Thank you too. And i already calculated the test
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 10:54pm PDT
:)
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 10:54pm PDT
adriannnn i have to say thank you so much for your work on the powerpoint <3 i'll try to get to the chi square on the paper in another 10-15 minutes so that you don't have to stay up too much doing this
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 10:24pm PDT
 
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 10:02pm PDT
woo we've hit 35 pages and i'm not even 1/2 way done w/ statistical analysis yoooo
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 10:02pm PDT
Yup! If you want, I'll explain a little more after we've hit 50 pages on the paper. If Ekeruo asks any questions tomorrow about the ranking, I'll answer them because I'm the one who did the algorithms, but you need to know enough so I'll at least tell you before we present :)
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 9:55pm PDT
So 1 point per rank?
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 5:10pm PDT
I'll get into it.
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 4:44pm PDT
hey adrian, do you have a binder that we can keep the pages of the paper in? i don't have any at home sorry :/
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 4:15pm PDT
Unless Mr E says something about it
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 4:15pm PDT
 
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 4:15pm PDT
i don't want that to happen again
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 4:15pm PDT
i remember what happened during the presentation last semester
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 4:15pm PDT
it's basically a unity thing
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 4:15pm PDT
i will promise to do the same for you
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 4:14pm PDT
adrian, as another note, during the presentation, if i say something, please don't openly disagree with it or try to clarify it. i know we both want to get good grades and disagreeing will only get our points confused and mr. ekeruo will likely deduct from our score
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 3:56pm PDT
got it. thanks :)
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 3:56pm PDT
If you want to take a look at it

thank you
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 3:51pm PDT
3rd and 1st respectively
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 3:50pm PDT
adrian, which classes did you survey for english -- i mean gialdini period ? and wilkinson period ?
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 12:16pm PDT
Coming in
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 12:07pm PDT
wait what about you?
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 12:07pm PDT
i'm not ditching. we have a presentation and physics checkin to deal w/ :/ don't worry, i'll be up there w/ you tmrw in stats
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:32am PDT
I heard it is senior ditch day tomorrow. Are you coming to school tomorrow?
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 9:05pm PDT
Just in case.
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 8:19pm PDT
hey adrian do you think we should actually write a 50 page paper like last semester
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 7:30pm PDT
 
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 7:30pm PDT
i'll continue the chi square test and when i'm done, i'll finish mine
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 7:30pm PDT
Good plan
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 7:30pm PDT

thank you so much :)))
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 7:26pm PDT
All done
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 7:17pm PDT
if there aren't any more, please message me now b/c i'm going to start the test and then we can't add others
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 6:56pm PDT
Yes there are more sorry about that
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 6:46pm PDT
i need to know bc i can't start the test w/o knowing if everything's there
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 6:46pm PDT
hey adrian, are there any more data to enter?
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 6:16pm PDT
i'm going to start doing the chi square test on the survey analysis doc
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 6:15pm PDT
how many surveys do you have left to input?
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 4:31pm PDT
 
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 4:31pm PDT
scroll to the right or down to see the graphs / histograms
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 4:31pm PDT
adrian! thank you so much for updating the data sheet :)) if you're interested in seeing any of the data analysis i've been doing so far, check out https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/16RCORN-QVnFSUc0pkEbAJgUyBHmsMvJzVjP8I9-L190/edit?usp=sharing. i'll be adding more to that and the paper now
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 12:15pm PDT
I will
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 12:15pm PDT
ps don't forget to insert the english data when you get the chance (sorry for nagging about that lol)
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 12:10pm PDT
You too.
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 12:10pm PDT
hope you're having a great day even w/o prom haha
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 12:10pm PDT
so see you then
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 12:09pm PDT
but after about 2 i'll be working on the paper
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 12:09pm PDT
 
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 12:09pm PDT
i'll be going down to eat lunch
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 12:09pm PDT
thank you to you too
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 12:09pm PDT
Whoo! :D fixed them (needed some javascript code for that though bc google doesn't have inbuilt functions to help edit form responses)
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 11:59am PDT
Thank you though
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 11:59am PDT
Not really. I can proceed.
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 11:58am PDT
It's ok! I checked what we have now. Is there anything else to add or is that it? I'll fix your previous responses; there's a way to do that on google forms :)
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 10:21am PDT
I kind of did already. My bad.
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 10:21am PDT
thank you as well :)
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 10:21am PDT
also adrian, when you're entering ppl with ap physics c & 1 experience, just enter physics c bc that's what i did earlier (maximum physics experience)
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 10:05am PDT
Sounds good to me. Thank you
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 10:05am PDT
then, we'll start analysis & the paper
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 10:05am PDT
wait i'm going to be gone for about an hour but i'll be back by 11:30-12:00 so hopefully you won't have additional questions until then :D
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 10:04am PDT
it's displayed automatically every time you fill out the survey

here's the link to how the data in the spreadsheet looks like now
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 10:03am PDT
Yes!
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 10:01am PDT
Wait.. so we input data using the survey itself?
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 9:51am PDT
Sure
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 9:51am PDT
hi adrian! almost done w/ uploading / inserting my parts into the survey & spreadsheet. what about you? we need more physics c and english data to cluster & stratify correctly!
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 9:12am PDT
Good*
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 9:12am PDT
 
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 9:12am PDT
it'll make it into the spreadsheet automatically bc i linked them
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 9:12am PDT
Sound goog
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 9:12am PDT
if you have any english data, type it directly into the form
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 9:11am PDT
ok so i reconsidered and perhaps it would be best to enter every response onto the google form (link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfCYOb0B6jXqbWKaxXwuuuGt3qDOJE2Ke-ZvZ8_z1PEghPhyw/viewform) because i have the spreadsheet linked to it (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J-Aph_219pudVS7tyPA2QB_-q5PSOSASJjfMXc8eTms/edit#gid=194841083)

YAY ADRIAN THANKS
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 9:05am PDT
we should also practice presenting at some point, if you're not too busy, we can even meet up at the library?
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 9:05am PDT
I am not going. So I can help you with that.
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 9:05am PDT
i'll keep fb open if you need to talk about anything, and i'll post the excel link of my data here when i've finished it :)
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 9:04am PDT
Hey Adrian! I'm planning on working on the paper and presentation this morning... wbu (are you going to prom; if so, i know you'll be busy)?
Friday, May 19, 2017 at 11:32am PDT
Got the rest of the data. It went well for me. How are you doing Lily?
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:49pm PDT
And you too. How kind.
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:49pm PDT
I got both. I can do it read period since She is not that far.
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:49pm PDT
you're the real mvp :D
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:49pm PDT
but thank you so much adrian!
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:49pm PDT
lol i was typing while you were
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:48pm PDT
 
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:48pm PDT
ah i see :)
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:48pm PDT
oh, so will you do both, or one?
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:48pm PDT
I got it covered and results will be determined tomorrow.
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:48pm PDT
Wilkinson's is on the way.
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:48pm PDT
are you ok with doing Gialdini?
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:47pm PDT
Oh, that's actually really smart! We can focus on 9th grade english (gialdini, if she says yes) and i'll ask if i can go to one of wilkinson's english classes tmrw (sophomore year)
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:47pm PDT
i start with freshmen and sophomores because we do not want people who take physics in our control test.
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:46pm PDT
tell me what you think we should do about the english classes k?
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:46pm PDT
we can go talk to gialdini tmrw during break...
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:45pm PDT
wbu in terms of english?
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:45pm PDT
i'm going to get more from benn tmrw for 5th period!
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:45pm PDT
 
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:45pm PDT
i got the data from licht 4th period and benn 4th period
Thursday, May 18, 2017 at 3:45pm PDT
Hey Adrian!
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:57am PDT
Thus we have other projects to work on so we must start
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:56am PDT
So am I but we had been busy recently so...
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:56am PDT
sorry for being so lazy regarding that!
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:56am PDT
i'll start the writeup too this weekend!
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:56am PDT
:)
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:56am PDT
i might get it printed from costco or something bc it seems like a horrid waste of ink :/
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:56am PDT
Thank you. I will get that done.
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:55am PDT
15 pages of this for you and i'll print 15 myself
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:55am PDT
Sound good to me.

either way
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:54am PDT
sorry haha i can't think of anything else
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:54am PDT
do you have any better ideas?
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:54am PDT
Alright.
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:54am PDT
yeah... that's what i was thinking
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:54am PDT
but yeah, just for monday, i think we'll each need ~30 copies of the survey each (15 pages), i'll send you the link again
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:54am PDT
So generally we do clusters technically?
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:53am PDT
whichever ones are picked (like maybe 2 for physics 1 and 2 for english to balance physics c) will have a census
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:53am PDT
we'll use the random number generator and assign a number to each class
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:52am PDT
yup!
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:52am PDT
english classes bc generally those contain students from the same grade rather than sophomores being able to skip up to physics 1 for example (better stratification)
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:52am PDT
Sounds alright. But, do we pick these classes at random?
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:52am PDT
after that, we'll need to find some benn and licht physics 1 classes and use english classes as a control
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:52am PDT
you can do period 1 and i'll do period 4
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:51am PDT
basically, what i mean is that we'll first get data from physics c (census)
Saturday, May 13, 2017 at 8:51am PDT
adrian! so i tried again and it still didn't get approved, so i guess we'll print out the surveys and try to get them out to classes on monday
Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 6:28pm PDT
Alright. Go on, Lily.
Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 6:25pm PDT
hey adrian, i'm going to post our survey on the american high school page
Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 8:10pm PDT
Have a good day!
Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 8:10pm PDT
Stats - Practice FRQs. Physics - a short lab regarding coils; can be done tomorrow if absent Good luck for the tests and for our project, I will get into it. I thought of that for so long and I appreciate your reminder.
Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 7:11pm PDT
also, we need to start taking data for our survey & doing the paper -- i'll work on some of that tonight & we can talk tmrw :))
Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 7:11pm PDT
but i missed stats & physics -- we didn't do anything super important (e.g. lab) right? i know about the practice test in stats but we don't have to turn that in?
Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 7:10pm PDT
so i was ap testing every day this week in the morning :'( at least i only have 4 ap tests left #halfwaythru
Thursday, May 4, 2017 at 7:10pm PDT
HIIII ADRIANNN (lol this looks like i'm on drugs)
Thursday, April 6, 2017 at 10:04pm PDT
Lab work as usual (in stations) and tests are returned. Good luck on your results.
Thursday, April 6, 2017 at 9:15pm PDT
Hey Adrian! What did we do in physics today? (haha sorry, absent again. i pretty much have this perpetual cold lol)
Thursday, March 2, 2017 at 1:28pm PST
I had, but much worse.
Thursday, March 2, 2017 at 12:58pm PST
Thanks Adrian! I'm kinda stressed but mostly okay I guess. I ate like 2 scoops of ice cream yesterday & ended up getting a really bad cold, so I guess summer isn't as close as I thought it would be haha. Have you ever made an impulsive decision like me & lived to regret it? (wow that's such a deep question)
Thursday, March 2, 2017 at 12:46pm PST
Stats. Covered ch 23 (t-tests) and did a worksheet in addition to problems from p. 541 (1-8). As for the lab, it is all about electric potential. This is due next week on block. Unfortunately, I do not have the lab directions right now, but I do know that the main goal is to find a function for v(r). For the last bit, I am alright. How is yours?
Thursday, March 2, 2017 at 12:29pm PST
hey adrian! :) i was absent today, so is there any way you can let me know about what we did in stats & physics? it would be great if i could see a picture of the lab directions if you have it. sorry for bothering you haha & how are you doing?
Monday, December 12, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
Take your time.
Monday, December 12, 2016 at 9:55pm PST
Oh. I apologize.
Monday, December 12, 2016 at 9:54pm PST
Adrian, you don't need to worry. sorry, my laptop isn't working very well, i'll let you guys know in an hour when i'm done. i won't let you down
Monday, December 12, 2016 at 9:40pm PST
Sorry about that, but they need the last portion from you.
Monday, December 12, 2016 at 9:39pm PST
Lily, have you finished your part yet? Our group needs your part to complete the report.
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 10:20pm PST
And I do not mind the weird topics either.
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 10:19pm PST
Yeah. Speaking of the project, we started on it. I am working on the methodology earlier while observing our mates.
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 10:18pm PST
:)
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 10:18pm PST
sorry i'm being super weird
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 10:18pm PST
also, this is random, but your name just reminded me of adrien agreste a.k.a. cat noir haha from the animation tv show "miraculous ladybug"
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 10:17pm PST
:) ty again. tbh i don't understand stats class 90% of the time. & dw i will be working on the project this weekend
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 6:35pm PST
Stats is my lowest also; I really need to study hard, so don't worry.
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 6:34pm PST
Both. p. 340 (14-22) and a worksheet given in class about probability.
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:42pm PST
wait adrian, in stats, did we have any problems from the book or just worksheets? sorry i'm just distracting you at this point
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:38pm PST
tfw you're working on college apps & crying bc you're never going to get in (well, *i'm* never going to get in to my dream school -- rice)
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:37pm PST
what's your favorite and least favorite part of senior year?
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:37pm PST
ty adrian :) tbh i can't believe stats/math is my worst subject this year :/
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:35pm PST
Tomorrow it is.
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:35pm PST
We do. Stats has one about probability.
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:32pm PST
Thanks! so we don't have a quiz right?
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:10pm PST
The heights will cause such event by the way.
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:09pm PST
No problem. We did a lab in a group (3 people for each) and the goal was to finding the heights ratio such that the two tissue rolls (one is rolling downward with its end being held while the other is in free fall) land simultaneously. Take a video for such evidence (as in videos about these rolls dropped).
Thursday, December 8, 2016 at 5:05pm PST
adriannnnnn hi! :) sorry for bothering you but do you know what we did in physics? i had really bad allergies & couldn't come to school today :'(
Thursday, November 3, 2016 at 6:45pm PDT
I almost forgot. There is a Wiley assignment due tomorrow!
Thursday, November 3, 2016 at 6:27pm PDT
Definitely!
Thursday, November 3, 2016 at 6:27pm PDT
See you tomorrow!
Thursday, November 3, 2016 at 6:27pm PDT
 
Thursday, November 3, 2016 at 6:27pm PDT
Aw thanks Adrian! :) I'm feeling better already.
Thursday, November 3, 2016 at 6:26pm PDT
Yay about no test in stats! I think the worst part about tests is when there aren't enough calculators for everyone. Oh yeah, I saw that the lab grade had been updated. Thanks about letting me know about that lab in physics! I'll ask Licht for further info tomorrow.
Thursday, November 3, 2016 at 6:09pm PDT
And do not worry. You are not the only one. I was absent for two days straight a few weeks ago because of a short flu.
Thursday, November 3, 2016 at 6:02pm PDT
For stats, we spent class time on review regarding scatter plots, regressions, and linearization of those plots. No test tomorrow. In physics, we corrected the previous lab from a different class so in your case your class corrected my class. Also we started on a new lab regarding pendulums and it is due Monday. I hope you get well soon, Lily.
Thursday, November 3, 2016 at 5:50pm PDT
also, how are you doing? :) i feel like i'm the only one who gets sick this often and misses things haha
Thursday, November 3, 2016 at 5:49pm PDT
Hi Adrian! I was absent today :( because I got an eye infection so I missed physics & stats. Is there any way you can let me know what we did in those classes? ugh I really don't want to take the stats test tmrw tbh
Monday, May 23, 2016 at 5:52pm PDT
Can be individual. I am doin it solo.
Monday, May 23, 2016 at 4:03pm PDT
Hey Adrian! Do you know if the roller coaster project can be individual or do you need a group? ty :)
Saturday, April 2, 2016 at 9:01pm PDT
Yes.
Saturday, April 2, 2016 at 8:36pm PDT
Hi Adrian! Just checking, for calc, there are only 4 assignments due Monday, right?
Tuesday, March 22, 2016 at 3:44pm PDT
You too. 😊 Btw group project for calculus.
Tuesday, March 22, 2016 at 3:43pm PDT
Thanks! :) btw gl on the socratic seminar tmrw, although you won't need it :)
Tuesday, March 22, 2016 at 3:42pm PDT
Nothing other that the lab I guessed.
Tuesday, March 22, 2016 at 3:42pm PDT
Hey Adrian! Sorry I keep bothering you about physics hw, but is there any due tmrw? Ty in advance!
Monday, March 7, 2016 at 9:47pm PST
For the lab just do the calculations regarding momentum both before and after colliding. Then take a percent error to find out if momentum is conserved.
Monday, March 7, 2016 at 9:46pm PST
Hey Adrian! I was absent today so I missed Benn talking about what graphs/calculations we have to do for the collision lab. Will you please let me know what I have to do for these categories? Thanks in advance :)
Friday, January 22, 2016 at 10:01pm PST
I'll see you again.
Friday, January 22, 2016 at 10:01pm PST
How nice. I think you are a great person too. You managed to handle 5 AP classes, something I could not do.
Friday, January 22, 2016 at 10:01pm PST
see you in physics on monday :)
Friday, January 22, 2016 at 10:00pm PST
so you're amazing :)))
Friday, January 22, 2016 at 10:00pm PST
and I've seen you composing on the piano
Friday, January 22, 2016 at 10:00pm PST
Thanks Adrian! :) haha I keep asking you about Melosh, how irresponsible of me. :/ I don't think I did particularly well either, but even if you didn't make it, you're still a very smart person :) (I've seen you in calc and physics)
Friday, January 22, 2016 at 5:06pm PST
This might help. I did not make it though. 😞 But thank you, my friend.
Friday, January 22, 2016 at 5:05pm PST
 
Friday, January 22, 2016 at 2:41pm PST
Also, I'm sure you did amazing on the APeng finals :) I heard Smith posted already and you guys have a curve :D
Friday, January 22, 2016 at 2:40pm PST
Hey, Adrian, for Melosh, do you know what the 1/21 and 1/22 assignments are? I didn't see them on the board, so I'm wondering if they exist or if they will be collected on Monday.
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 5:04pm PST
 
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 5:03pm PST
Thanks! See you in physics, calc, and cse tmrw! I still can't believe we have half of our classes together
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 3:49pm PST
Basically you create a cross section area and find its area of the area you have sketched. The cross sectional area should be such that the configuration of the helicopter is the same as when it is in the air.
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 3:46pm PST
Hey Adrian, I'm super sorry for bothering you, but can you briefly explain the cross section calculations for the helicopter lab to me? I forgot to ask Benn :(
Friday, November 13, 2015 at 9:53pm PST

Hey Anthony! I heard you were head of newspaper for the Johnson project; is there any way for you to send us your group's articles after you're finished writing? I'm in the website group, and we need news for our content section.

Monday, May 29, 2017 at 12:29pm PDT

on the bright side, most colleges finish their spring semesters early!
Sunday, May 14, 2017 at 10:19pm PDT
omg yeah especially in math and physics classes! a bad grade can definitely make or break your final grade bc it's so close to the end of the semester
Sunday, May 14, 2017 at 10:18pm PDT

Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:09pm PDT
OH you have to read this book btw! sorry this is so random but i had to tell you i've been into kurt vonnegut recently
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:08pm PDT
but whatever college is depressing
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:08pm PDT
i'm pretty sure your school's acceptance rates are probably lower? idk we're ranked 2nd in the district besides mission so
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:07pm PDT
so what i've done isn't very impressive
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:07pm PDT
ppl here are so cutthroat
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:07pm PDT
haha wait let me count: illinois, amherst, georgia tech, maryland college park, texas austin, uc's (but everyone @ my school is far more competitive than that & are making fun of me for not applying to more ivy leagues)
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:06pm PDT
i think i applied to 13 in total
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:04pm PDT
and which schools have you been accepted to???
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:04pm PDT
computer science :)
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:04pm PDT
when those don't really matter in the long run
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:04pm PDT
what are you majoring in?
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:04pm PDT
they don't always find the ppl w/ the "spike" & care too much about grades
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:04pm PDT
honestly, college admissions is so random
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:04pm PDT
b/c you're way smarter than me at cs/math/whatever we eventually end up majoring in
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:03pm PDT
don't worry about regent's letters and stuff
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:03pm PDT
tbh i wish i was like you :)
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 6:03pm PDT
lol the only reason i've been accepted to 12 schools is probably because i applied to a bunch of safeties & because i applied to 22 total (apparently, that's super high at my school)
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 4:22pm PDT
i haven't got regents anywhere :(
Thursday, March 16, 2017 at 4:22pm PDT

Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:31pm PDT
haha if you don't you should
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:31pm PDT
do you watch anime?
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:31pm PDT
oh this is almost totally unrelated but i was watching steins;gate the other day
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:31pm PDT
oh ahaha i was talking about stats but you're right bc my physics teacher last year was called a "nasty old beanhead" by his students and this year, my teacher mumbles a lot
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:30pm PDT
i think physics teachers are weird lol
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:29pm PDT
but probably will hate it when it gets hard lol
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:29pm PDT
haha what is it with stats teachers not being good at each school?
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:29pm PDT
i like the subject of physics
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:29pm PDT
idk i like it less than calc
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:29pm PDT
did you like the subject in general?
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:29pm PDT
oh whoops :)
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:28pm PDT
HAHA yeah ppl actually record him saying that stuff in class. tbh he didn't even know he was advisor of math club, like the president walked in and said i talked to you about using this classroom today and he said "i didn't know math club existed"
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:26pm PDT
most of my friends say she can't teach
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:25pm PDT
so now this year the teacher isn't that great
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:25pm PDT
but the teacher retired
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:25pm PDT
i took it last year :)
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:25pm PDT
boogie boogie boogie
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:25pm PDT
what about stats at your school? tbh i'm not learning anything new bc my teacher is so bad at teaching
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:24pm PDT
literally, he's probably the weirdest person i know
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:24pm PDT
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MpQsCoa6HnE
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:23pm PDT

my teacher is so weird
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:23pm PDT
yup
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:23pm PDT
lol that feeling when you get a 77 on one test :/ and get a 98 on the next. like physics, what are you trying to tell me? my grades fluctuate so much :( you don't actually want my nonexistent brains haha
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:23pm PDT
are you taking stats?
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:22pm PDT
GIVE ME YOUR BRAINS LILY
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:22pm PDT
ugh i can't physics
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:22pm PDT
TEACH ME CASSANDRA
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:21pm PDT
oh, well still. i heard you guys learn quantum physics at the end :)))
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:20pm PDT
lots of review from physics 1 lol
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:20pm PDT
it's pretty easy
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:20pm PDT
well my physics teacher doesn't really teach so....
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:19pm PDT
omggg i never asked! how's physics 2? is it fun? what are you learning? i always thought 2 was cooler than c bc you guys actually learn new fields and info and stuff
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:18pm PDT
and i'm too lazy to self study lol
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:18pm PDT
only in physics 2
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:18pm PDT
nahh
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:18pm PDT
wait are you going to take the physics c exam? :D
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:18pm PDT
:P
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:17pm PDT
my self esteem went up drastically haha
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:17pm PDT
mostly bc almost everyone in my class is taking calc so they don't know anything about differential equations
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:17pm PDT
haha ik but it's pretty interesting
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:17pm PDT
lolll i bet i was worse than you bc my thing kept getting eaten by the bigger circles :'( i think the max i was was like 40 units or something
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:16pm PDT
that sound crazy
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:16pm PDT
omg calc in physics
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:16pm PDT
i suck at it
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:16pm PDT
omg i played agar.io before
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:16pm PDT
like today we learned about drag and differential equations in physics yaya
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:15pm PDT
but there's fun stuff too
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:15pm PDT
such is life. i sound so depressing

Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 5:14pm PDT

Saturday, May 28, 2016 at 5:16pm PDT
you'll do amazing :)
Saturday, May 28, 2016 at 5:16pm PDT
you're probably just smarter than me :) it's things like this that make me feel stupid bc maybe i just can't keep up with the work. but i still get good grades on tests, which ends up confusing me... oh well. i actually started out this weekend with 21 homework assignments. i've cut it down to 12 so far
Saturday, May 28, 2016 at 5:16pm PDT
sighhhh
Saturday, May 28, 2016 at 5:16pm PDT

Saturday, May 28, 2016 at 5:14pm PDT
a bunch of people transfer to that school cuz it's easier to get the same GPA for a LOT less work
Saturday, May 28, 2016 at 5:14pm PDT
it's not even funny....
Saturday, May 28, 2016 at 5:13pm PDT
there's a school called santa rosa high school in which students only get like 1 hour of hw everyday
Saturday, May 28, 2016 at 5:13pm PDT
it's funny because my school is considered the most academic in sonoma county, and it doesn't even compare to yours
Saturday, May 28, 2016 at 5:12pm PDT
maybe because in the past, many parents and students complained about the workload at my school, so the hw and stuff was cut down a lot
Saturday, May 28, 2016 at 5:12pm PDT
*imagine
Saturday, May 28, 2016 at 5:12pm PDT

ok, so lagrange error is basically like when the error is the next term in the series i.e. (nth derivative of f)/n! * (x-c)^n, but the (nth derivative of f) is at its maximum value
Tuesday, May 3, 2016 at 11:02pm PDT

Thursday, February 11, 2016 at 8:14pm PST
lollll so straight a's but bc he has unweighted, the gpa goes down

Sunday, August 16, 2015 at 10:40pm PDT
and never send it
Sunday, August 16, 2015 at 10:40pm PDT

Sunday, August 16, 2015 at 10:40pm PDT
you brave gryffindor
Sunday, August 16, 2015 at 10:40pm PDT
honestly i was like you before
Sunday, August 16, 2015 at 10:40pm PDT

Sunday, August 16, 2015 at 10:40pm PDT
(ik you're right, just too scared to actually do it)
Sunday, August 16, 2015 at 10:39pm PDT
fine. i shall consider your advice
Sunday, August 16, 2015 at 10:39pm PDT

Sunday, August 16, 2015 at 10:38pm PDT

Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:32pm PDT
So I'm just going to bring it with me.
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:32pm PDT
True. But I'm too scared I'll forget equations.
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:30pm PDT
but when i bring the entire script, i can never find where i stop
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:30pm PDT
that's good
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:30pm PDT
I'm going to bring my script in case, but I won't completely read off.
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:30pm PDT
Yes, and technically, you can bring your entire script.
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:29pm PDT
we're allowed to have notes right?
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:29pm PDT

Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:29pm PDT
I need to practice :( but I'm putting it off for you
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:29pm PDT
That means we can talk about something other than the final project. :)
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:28pm PDT
haha thanks :)
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:28pm PDT
Same. I think you're fine then. Good job!
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:27pm PDT
i already turned in my paper
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:27pm PDT
i don't think i did
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:26pm PDT
Oh. I've had previous experience writing math papers, so I hope it's good this time. :\ Yours isn't that informal. It's more formal than Trevor's at least. Just make sure you don't use "you"
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:25pm PDT
i used my own voice in my paper, so it's kind of informal haha
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:25pm PDT
ok
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:25pm PDT
Same. No. I rewrote my entire script as though I was explaining it to a friend. The structure is similar to my paper, but the content is much more informal.
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:24pm PDT
like copied and pasted?
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:24pm PDT
is your script mainly based off of your paper?
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:24pm PDT
i talk too fast :/
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:24pm PDT
3 minutes is actually a good length. Right now, mine is 7-ish.
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:23pm PDT
It's ok. I read your paper and it's very good. You'll have an amazing presentation. I'm not even kidding.
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:22pm PDT
my presentation will probably end up being 3 mins
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:22pm PDT
but idk what else to add
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:22pm PDT
i feel like i don't have enough slides
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:22pm PDT
but I'm omitting one proof (one slide) for RSA
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:21pm PDT
My powerpoint is 18 slides total.
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:21pm PDT
Oh ahha I hope so. Thank you :) I don't act like I'm alone... but if you say so. Lol sure, unfortunately you still don't go to my school :(
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:21pm PDT

Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:18pm PDT
Also, I'm afraid people will find mistakes in my calculations.
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:18pm PDT
You will do well. You don't need any help. I get stage fright.
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:18pm PDT
Thank you :) I shall cheer for you as well. And make weird faces to the best of my ability.
Wednesday, July 29, 2015 at 8:17pm PDT

Wednesday, September 23, 2015 at 11:31pm PDT

Wednesday, September 23, 2015 at 11:13pm PDT
YES!! We should talk in physics and English more (although English might be hard with gialdini) 😞
Wednesday, September 23, 2015 at 11:13pm PDT
Omg no problem! And no I don't think there was any HW for physics!
Wednesday, September 23, 2015 at 10:50pm PDT

btw, you could make this very simple, just write all of the text over a pretty picture like this one!
Wednesday, February 11, 2015 at 9:23pm PST
thank you so much lily!
Wednesday, February 11, 2015 at 9:21pm PST
also write in the side or near the bottom "get service hours!"
Wednesday, February 11, 2015 at 9:19pm PST
just write "Interested in gardening?" on the top, and then put the info at the middle/bottom "Come join us from 3:30-5pm at the Gazebo behind the Science Portables" and if you could put on the side, or near the bottom "wear good shoes!"
Wednesday, February 11, 2015 at 9:18pm PST
Hey lily! could you make a simple gardening flyer ?
Tuesday, February 3, 2015 at 11:02pm PST
btw its in the little multipurpose room at AHS!
Tuesday, February 3, 2015 at 10:57pm PST
Hey Lily! Wanna come to the API Karaoke Night on Feb 20th from 7-9pm? Tickets are being sold NOW @SAC for $5! Food and drinks ( boba milk tea from me ^_^) will be provided. Check out the flyer below! (being an asian and having talent is optional--everyone is welcome!)
Thursday, January 22, 2015 at 5:32pm PST

Thursday, January 22, 2015 at 3:02pm PST
Oh, sorry. I'll be able to come to the Friday 12:30-3:30 sort session. Will the Lucky's thing happen during that time?
Wednesday, January 21, 2015 at 10:27pm PST

Thursday, November 13, 2014 at 8:55pm PST
Oh, sorry Denise. About the meeting on Monday, I liked the post, but I just remembered I'll be at least 5 minutes late. Is that all right? Sorry for forgetting.
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:58pm PST
oh and yes the second one is better :D
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:58pm PST
but thanks it looks awesome :D
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:57pm PST
so anything with the least amount of color to give the clearest message would be best.
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:57pm PST
and we may want something to post up around the school
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:57pm PST
because i was thinking like we want of stack of these to be in gateway to be handed out
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:56pm PST
but take out the background color and the colored font?
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:56pm PST
so i mean the fruit can have color
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:56pm PST
is it possible for the printed flyers to be in black and white?
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:56pm PST
i like the profile pic flyers!
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:36pm PST
Thanks for the advice and sorry for not getting it right the first time!
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:36pm PST
I tried to make it as light and the fonts as thin as possible without making it look completely ugly. Tell me if I need to improve this.
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:36pm PST
 
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:35pm PST
For the printed flyers, let me know if you think this is ok:
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:35pm PST
I like this second one more. I didn't want to take out the fruits though so I just used this. Tell me if you want me to take the fruits out or if this is satisfactory for the profile picture.
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:34pm PST
 
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:34pm PST
 
Sunday, November 9, 2014 at 10:32pm PST
So I was thinking using color for the profile picture would look brighter and catchier because if I lightened the look, it would be dull. So, the following two are possibilities for profile pics:
Saturday, November 8, 2014 at 7:39pm PST
thanks ^_^
Saturday, November 8, 2014 at 5:14pm PST
Okay, I'll fix it as soon as I can.
Saturday, November 8, 2014 at 2:11pm PST

Saturday, November 8, 2014 at 2:11pm PST

Saturday, November 8, 2014 at 2:11pm PST

Saturday, November 8, 2014 at 2:10pm PST
but it does look really cool
Saturday, November 8, 2014 at 2:10pm PST
OR u don't have to use fruit to spell out the words haha
Saturday, November 8, 2014 at 2:10pm PST

Saturday, November 8, 2014 at 2:10pm PST

I like watches too! But generally just the classic, round ones haha I also like keeping one at a time for a span of several years so that it can be like my little "companion"/piece of memory so to say haha. It's corny, I know 󾌴
Friday, August 19, 2016 at 9:31am PDT
Yay!! :D Trust me, you don't need a watch to "look" smart :) 󾌴
Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:26pm PDT
Hi Kiran! Thanks :) I definitely did. It's weird but my favorite present ended up being a watch. Ever since I was a kid, I always wanted one of those huge squarish digital watches because I thought they'd make me look smart (haha) and I finally have one yay. :D

Just make sure your files are named right so Millard uses the right url to give you points :)
Saturday, January 16, 2016 at 10:16pm PST
So, basically all of the necessary files are in Millard's locker. You edit them according to the packet directions, drag them all from the computer interface for filezilla into the host service, and then everything's visible.
Saturday, January 16, 2016 at 10:15pm PST
Its 2.2.3
Saturday, January 16, 2016 at 10:12pm PST
Are you talking about the assignment like 2.2.something or the group project?
Saturday, January 16, 2016 at 10:12pm PST
Wait so do you know how to upload the mysql thing to filezilla and make it work on web browser
Saturday, January 16, 2016 at 10:10pm PST

Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 5:44pm PST
Hello! I'm sorry you haven't heard from me so far (I'm super irresponsible for this), but as you probably know, you're my Service Accountant intern. As I first received the hours about a week ago, I've just gotten around to entering them in and setting up the spreadsheet, which you can find in the shared SciEco club folder.

loll you probably don't have to. just checking :D i'm sure you'll do very well (cough100%cough)
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:08pm PDT
I didn't know we had to describe a typical day
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:08pm PDT
But I did over all what I would spend in a month
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:08pm PDT
I didn't know we had to go into that much detail haha
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:08pm PDT
i don't want to make any mistakes before turning yours in
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:08pm PDT
Ohhh I see what you're saying
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:08pm PDT
just making sure!
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:08pm PDT
but yeah his is likely not the only right way to do the assignment
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:08pm PDT
lol i'm modeling off of his
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:08pm PDT
idk Sabeel had one in his packet so i'm putting one in mine. but i didn't read through yours so if you think you have everything, you're probably right! :)) idk on the directions it says that the paper is more about reflection on your life & Sabeel's was v philosophical & like how a normal day would be
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:06pm PDT
And I put how much I would like to spend overall in a month
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:06pm PDT
Do we have to do a separate list or something??
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:06pm PDT
Thank you! No that's ok....I put how much I would spend each month on things in my write up though
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:05pm PDT
sorry!
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:05pm PDT
so i looked for it
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:05pm PDT
and your packet seemed a little thin
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:05pm PDT
it's worth 25 pts
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:05pm PDT
idk if your packet includes an itemized monthly budget?
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:04pm PDT
but i just want to let you know sth
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:04pm PDT
i will
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:04pm PDT
sure :)
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:04pm PDT
YES
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:04pm PDT
I really appreciate it :)
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:04pm PDT
Thanks soooo much!!!
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:04pm PDT

:) we had to write a limerick for some environment event (i don't even know) and ours was basically "Growing urbanization in Bay Area suburbs / Decreases green land for freeways and sidewalk curbs / Taller, larger skyscrapers lead to habitat fragmentation / Building materials pollute, causing species decimation / When will we learn we're part of nature, like herbs?"
Friday, May 12, 2017 at 10:58pm PDT
A limerick??? Haha why did you have to write that
Friday, May 12, 2017 at 10:57pm PDT
Yess lol for the brochure Alison's the other person in our group and I'll add to it
Friday, May 12, 2017 at 10:57pm PDT
Yeah my sister was there haha and thanks so much :)
Friday, May 12, 2017 at 8:37pm PDT
ahhh i didn't see you at school today! :/ we had a work day in econ and wrote a limerick in apes (don't ask, our group probably got ec points but it was pretty stupid)
Friday, May 12, 2017 at 8:37pm PDT
also, on the brochure project, ik you're in my group, but who else is there? i forgot haha. i shared the document w/ you so if you could add the others that would be great
Friday, May 12, 2017 at 8:36pm PDT
hahahaha my voice is utter trash but ty for the compliment (my future occupation for the real life project has 0% chance of being "singer")
Friday, May 12, 2017 at 8:35pm PDT
lol i didn't even see your message about identifying who you were in the video but i could still recognize you :D (and your sister, i believe? hopefully i didn't mess up on thinking she was there as well)
Friday, May 12, 2017 at 8:34pm PDT
:)
Friday, May 12, 2017 at 8:34pm PDT
omg anisha you are so amazing at dancing :O wow all of those moves must require a lot of stamina and practice and coordination (if i had to follow choreography, i'd probably forget all the steps and end up in the wrong place and confuse everyone so i admire your abilities very much)
Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:22pm PDT
omg lily you actually have a really nice voice!!!!
Saturday, May 6, 2017 at 8:21pm PDT

Tuesday, April 4, 2017 at 10:29am PDT

Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 5:54pm PDT
honestly, my mom's going to india this summer & when she asked my sis & me if we wanted to go, we said <b><i>no</i></b>
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 5:54pm PDT
why does india smell like sewage
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 5:53pm PDT
also, btw now i smell sewage everywhere
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 5:53pm PDT
haha i'm too late anyways
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 5:53pm PDT
yeah sure! :) omg you don't have to ask
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 5:40pm PDT
so since the format is diff we can just change the original ppt to the new questions and keep the same format and then copy and paste that picture
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 5:38pm PDT
so its different than the original one
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 5:38pm PDT
because I added the greasy pizza box and stuff remember
Thursday, March 30, 2017 at 5:37pm PDT

Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 10:58pm PDT
Well I like lions and tigers and they're technically in the cat family
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 10:58pm PDT
No I don't like cats haha
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 10:21pm PDT
btw, this is random, but there isn't an econ test tmrw right? haha i got nervous bc i thought johnson said something about a test on monday but technically we haven't turned in the workbook fun yet
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 10:20pm PDT
i think i asked you before, but you don't like cats v much, right?
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 10:20pm PDT
omg for some reason whenever i see an alaskan malamute i think of a husky. they're so adorable :))) but yeah, i feel the same way about dogs and cats and pretty much every animal
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:22pm PDT
pretty much any dog :P
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:22pm PDT
but I also love German shepherds and labs
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:21pm PDT
they're probably my favorite
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:21pm PDT
I really like huskies or alaskan malamutes
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:21pm PDT
lol well the dogs can help ease that out :P
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:21pm PDT
what's your favorite dog?
Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:21pm PDT

Sunday, March 26, 2017 at 3:21pm PDT

Monday, March 20, 2017 at 9:08pm PDT
np :) haha you're good I was super confused at first too
Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:29pm PDT
ty :) tbh this just goes to show how horrible i am w/ any form of technology, i think i used the wrong link at first
Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:23pm PDT
and you just make an account
Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:23pm PDT
where the password is fishslap
Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:23pm PDT
and join the private league
Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:23pm PDT
so basically use this link
Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:23pm PDT
http://www.wallstreetsurvivor.com/league/MrJalwayswins
Monday, March 20, 2017 at 8:22pm PDT
anishaaaa help do you know how to sign up for the econ wall street thingy? i remember you said something about "fish slap" but idk what you were talking about. what is a league? lol is a direction sheet somewhere?
Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 5:50pm PDT
The only answers is where a-f go in terms of trash recycling or compost
Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 5:49pm PDT
And we won't know till we do the audit and based on that we can see how close they are
Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 5:49pm PDT
It's just their assumptions of what the percentage of compost/recycling in the landfill is
Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 5:49pm PDT
Well only know after the waste audit
Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 5:49pm PDT
Oh but we don't know the percentages
Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 5:48pm PDT
whatever's more convenient for you. haha tbh i don't remember all the percentages, so it would be great if you could at least put those in the presentation notes?
Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 5:46pm PDT
So a slide at the end? The answers are pretty simple if you look at the survey but if you want I can add it
Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 5:45pm PDT
Ok cool
Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 5:32pm PDT
rn he says that he'll be @ thornton by 10:20. i think he'll also be bringing the waste audit materials w/ him but i emailed to ask just in case
Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 5:32pm PDT
also, i emailed hugo, so we'll see what he says
Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 5:32pm PDT
yes, it would be great if you could add a slide near the end w/ the answers so we can go over their initial ideas & contrast. we can even have a short 2-3 minute reflection session where we discuss what they've learned (part of the presentation)
Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 4:45pm PDT
do you need the answers to discuss with the kids after or are you good?
Tuesday, March 14, 2017 at 4:44pm PDT
hey! so I put the small prior knowledge survey on the powerpoint
Monday, March 13, 2017 at 6:03pm PDT
please let me know asap because if he doesn't know we may need to postpone the field trip
Monday, March 13, 2017 at 5:59pm PDT
wheaton was asking us today and you told you you emailed him so if not we should really get in contact with him
Monday, March 13, 2017 at 5:59pm PDT
he's coming on Wednesday and bringing the bins and stuff right?
Monday, March 13, 2017 at 5:59pm PDT
also lily have you been in contact with Hugo?
Sunday, March 12, 2017 at 10:44am PDT
just let me know what you think and where to cut it down so we can send it to Frick :)

hey lily! I complete forgot to send this to you but heres the link to my survey
Monday, November 28, 2016 at 7:16am PST
But you did so much omg I feel so bad now
Monday, November 28, 2016 at 7:16am PST
Omg dude it's perfect I woke up earlier thinking I'd work on it since I wasn't sure what to put last night and fell asleep at like 1
Monday, November 28, 2016 at 5:54am PST
Ok sounds good! :)
Monday, November 28, 2016 at 2:04am PST
Hey Anisha, sorry for not seeing this earlier but I finished writing the analysis & printed the pamphlet out! if you have any problems w/ it, let me know @ lunch (I'll probably be in the library) & we can reprint but tbh I think we did more work than 30 points requires haha
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 11:35pm PST
Lily do you have any idea what you might want to write?
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 10:05pm PST
yeah I'm really not sure what to write for the analysis i was trying to word something out but it just wasn't working
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:59pm PST
and what do you wanna write for the analysis?
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:58pm PST
yeah this is such a struggle honestly
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:58pm PST
oh yeah i saw the graph its really good
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:58pm PST
yeah i know honestly she needs to step up her game with teaching lol
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:56pm PST
also, on the pamphlet, i inserted this graph i made from downloaded data except the space for the 2nd column is too small. idk what even to do now :/
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:55pm PST
lol i think wheaton sometimes forgets that we have college apps & a life outside school. i don't know anybody who regularly goes to sleep before 11
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:54pm PST
haha maybe she was in a good mood that day
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:54pm PST
lol tbh i thought she was going to be more responsible with apes bc we basically learned nothing in bio but apparently not
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:36pm PST
if we email her at that time she's usually like why aren't you guys in bed
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:36pm PST
lol that is surprising
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:36pm PST
exactly she never explains anything omg
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:35pm PST
i was surprised
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:35pm PST
one time she replied at 9
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:35pm PST
yup I don't think she replies after 7:00 anyway
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:35pm PST
i don't even understand 90% of this project
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:35pm PST
ikr
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:35pm PST
Yes! I don't want to present about sand crabs anyway lol. If we're not presenting, I think 1 copy should be ok.
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:33pm PST
and the relevance part was ok right?
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:31pm PST
should we email her and ask? although I'm not sure if shell reply
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:31pm PST
idk she wasn't really specific in her instructions
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:31pm PST
so im assuming just one copy of a pamphlet then?
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:30pm PST
no we dont have to share it lol
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:30pm PST
ok good yeah i thought the graph perfectly showed what we wanted haha
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:30pm PST
hopefully not haha
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:30pm PST
wait we don't have to share out in class, right?
Sunday, November 27, 2016 at 6:30pm PST
No, I'm totally ok with it! wow you did so much work. :) i like the graph btw. I'm going to go back to the database and see if we can find more graphs to put (specific to pescadero)
Saturday, November 26, 2016 at 10:41am PST
actually females with eggs versus total number of crabs found
Saturday, November 26, 2016 at 10:39am PST
but I'm assuming its not just from pescadero
Saturday, November 26, 2016 at 10:39am PST
i found a graph that shows the change in females with and without eggs over the past 10 years on the limpets webiste
Saturday, November 26, 2016 at 10:38am PST
if we change our question a bit
Saturday, November 26, 2016 at 10:33am PST
hey lily! so what graphs do you want to use for the middle column of our pamphlet?
Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:56pm PST
and i feel like just one side of a pamphlet is no where near enough space with the research she expects us to do
Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:54pm PST
she wasn't very specific in her instructions so
Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:54pm PST
as for the presentation all i remember her saying is we need to do a pamphlet and I'm assuming we would need a copy for everyone in the calss
Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:53pm PST
ill start looking at some info and adding it to the notes
Sunday, November 20, 2016 at 1:53pm PST
hey lily! i just saw your email
Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 4:51pm PDT
of course! :D
Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 4:50pm PDT
thank you! :)
Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 3:16pm PDT
So as soon as she gives you a copy of the report I'll give you the data :)
Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 3:16pm PDT
We did do a lab in Wheaton but it was kind of different so everyone in class has the same data
Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 3:15pm PDT
It's no bother at all!
Thursday, October 20, 2016 at 2:41pm PDT
hi anisha! i was absent today ( :/ except for stats, which i would gladly miss any day haha) so do you know if we had any in-class assignments/homework/labs in wheaton? sorry for bothering you!
Sunday, October 16, 2016 at 2:31pm PDT
hey lily! i was wondering if you could please give me edit access to the google doc so i can add in my part of the red vs. blue once I'm done reading the article
Saturday, May 24, 2014 at 6:17pm PDT
You're welcome :)
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:31pm PDT
Awww thanks <3 haha it's an ok picture
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:30pm PDT
Yeah sure we can talk later :)
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:20pm PDT
Btw, your profile picture is really pretty. :)
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:19pm PDT
Sure, I have to go to sleep anyway. Is it ok if we talk later? :)
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:19pm PDT
One sec I'll be right back
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:19pm PDT
Haha mines a B right now
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:18pm PDT
Grade right now: 93.13% Hanging on to an A barely. I bet it goes down to B after timed write
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:18pm PDT
No I'm pretty sure you're not that bad
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:17pm PDT
Nope, not true. I'm terrible at English. Always have been and always will be. :(
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:17pm PDT
No you're intellectual too so I bet what you're saying is right :)
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:16pm PDT
I think everyone in my class is nice too, except they're really intellectual. It makes me feel nervous sometimes, like I might be saying something wrong.
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:15pm PDT
The people in my class are pretty nice about that stuff
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:15pm PDT
smartness * 3
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:15pm PDT
I have Kathryn & Manasi & Sujay
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:15pm PDT
That was sappy. I don't know; depends on the people in your class.
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:14pm PDT
Haha that's true :)

Wait, they didn't laugh at you, they were laughing with you :)
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:14pm PDT
Awww I'm sorry :( last time people laughed at me because the last time I spoke was for the impromptu speaking
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:13pm PDT
I can't do that last part :) Seriously, the last time I presented in front of the class, I bet even Gialdini felt sorry for me. :'(
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:12pm PDT
The thing is I'm scared but I end up doing a decent job
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:11pm PDT
I'm worse than you, I bet! :)
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:11pm PDT
Nervousness always gets the best of me
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 10:11pm PDT
I'm good :) I'm really scared I'm not good at public speaking
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 8:01pm PDT
I'm really nervous.
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 8:01pm PDT
I'm great! How are you? What are your feelings about the public speaking speech in English class? ;)
Friday, May 23, 2014 at 7:26pm PDT
Hi!! :) how are you :D

I finished everything else
Thursday, December 22, 2016 at 10:44am PST
Can u please send the data asap
Thursday, December 22, 2016 at 10:44am PST
Lol we didn't get to finish
Wednesday, December 21, 2016 at 8:03pm PST
Hey Lily we need the data for the lab
Sunday, October 2, 2016 at 1:29pm PDT
Yea we can talk about that in the conclusion
Sunday, October 2, 2016 at 1:29pm PDT
Thank you

Sunday, October 2, 2016 at 11:44am PDT
Sorry for the delay in sending you the lab data. We didn't take more than 1 for each, but I added some for uncertainty calculations for the writeup. Degrees Height 45 71.8cm, 71.8cm, 71.9cm 50 82.7cm, 81.6cm, 82.9 60 114.5cm, 113.2, 113.8 65 119.5cm, 120.0, 119.6 68 124.0cm, 124.3, 124.2 69 124.5cm, 124.5, 124.4 70 124.3cm, 124.2, 124.1 We still need 15 data points, but we only have 7. I'm not sure what we should do about that. We can just state in the conclusion that we didn't have enough time to accumulate more data and would have done so if we did?

It’s okay. I think I’ll just use the one I have rn. My Senior project presentation, calc final and AP euro are all tmr lol.
Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 4:19pm PDT
i'll send you a picture when i'm done
Wednesday, June 7, 2017 at 4:19pm PDT
sorry about canceling on you, but i'm not feeling v well today, so we should probably work on our parts individually, and i'll print them out and put them on the poster
Tuesday, June 6, 2017 at 8:28am PDT
It'd be fine for me
Tuesday, June 6, 2017 at 8:27am PDT
what do you think?
Tuesday, June 6, 2017 at 8:27am PDT
pls be there before 5 or sth? so we can work on the poster & finalize our presentation & stuff
Tuesday, June 6, 2017 at 8:27am PDT
my address is 34782 Comstock Common, Fremont, etc.
Tuesday, June 6, 2017 at 8:26am PDT
also, i'm pretty much officially inviting you to my house after school wednesday (come whenever's convenient but pls come) bc i can't really work on physics tonight (senior project & CS final)
Tuesday, June 6, 2017 at 8:25am PDT
whatever that's harder than i made it sound
Tuesday, June 6, 2017 at 8:25am PDT
lolll you're not gonna know many ppl but at least you can make new friends?
Tuesday, June 6, 2017 at 8:25am PDT

Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:22pm PDT
There're only 5 ppl going to UCSD with me lol
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:22pm PDT

Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:17pm PDT
cya
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:17pm PDT

Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:16pm PDT
:)
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:16pm PDT
I SHOULD
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:16pm PDT
Yeah I’ll take that advice lol
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:16pm PDT
haha
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:16pm PDT
but honestly i think you should get extra credit now
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:16pm PDT
yes. none of this is on the sheet. also i only have like 13 orders pls don't stay up all night & make 1000 entries lolll
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:15pm PDT
And for the orders we just randomly put some data in too?
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:15pm PDT
 
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:15pm PDT
Got it
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:15pm PDT
you can pick the others based on what info you want to display by your command
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:14pm PDT
so generally inventory should be one of them (shoe id, store id as foreign keys)
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:14pm PDT
the linkage happens between a table with the primary keys of the 2 other tables as foreign keys
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:14pm PDT
but basically think about which tables you want to link
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:14pm PDT
haha yes, you should do that
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:13pm PDT
But I’ll do fewer shoes for inventory lol
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:13pm PDT
you only need like 2 sizes for each shoe type. idk if he mentioned in your period. but i was actually trying in the beginning and i only have 200 entries
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:13pm PDT
I was sleeping in class so didn’t hear no instruction
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:13pm PDT
I thought we were supposed to do that...
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:13pm PDT
you're such an overachiever
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:13pm PDT
whyyyy
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:13pm PDT
but still
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:13pm PDT
jk
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:13pm PDT
lol what a masochist
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:12pm PDT
what have you done to yourself
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:12pm PDT
OMG SHUAI
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:12pm PDT
AHHHH
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:12pm PDT
what i did for the inner join was to link inventory, orders, and shoes together and return the number of each shoe ordered total
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:12pm PDT
RIP
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:12pm PDT
I’ve entered like 600 shoes
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:12pm PDT
there's too many combinations
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:12pm PDT
honestly, don't try to do that for every shoe
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:11pm PDT
yeah, it's not specified, so you can pick any number
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:11pm PDT
Do we just assign a random number of amount of shoes
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:11pm PDT
e.g. shoeper duper contains 47 givenchy knee high boots size 56
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:10pm PDT
so basically inventory hold info about which store contains which shoes and of what amount
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:10pm PDT
I’ve entered all the shoes and create inventory and order. But I don’t quite understand what inventory means
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:09pm PDT
it took me a long time to understand the syntax, so is that what you're having trouble with?
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:09pm PDT
okay, so basically you need 1 command at the end which is a 3-table join. inner join is the only one we learned in class, so ppl are generally using a 3-table inner join
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:08pm PDT
I heard ppl were talking about inner join but I don’t know how&why we are supposed to use it
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:08pm PDT
what exactly is the issue w/ the database project?
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:08pm PDT
Same
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:08pm PDT
nah it's fine haha i've given up on grades and stuff
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:07pm PDT
I hope im not disturbing you from doing any project lol
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:07pm PDT
:) what do you need help w/?
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:07pm PDT
If you are free
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:07pm PDT

Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:06pm PDT
OMG HAHAHA i really don't think they care though they're probably looking forward to their retirement / next job or whatevs
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:06pm PDT
Probably yeah
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:05pm PDT
OMG I feel so sorry for them. Cuz I stopped doing homework since a few weeks ago...
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:05pm PDT
i feel like they are all jumping off the sinking ship of ahs
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:05pm PDT
yup! i heard it's his last year here
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:05pm PDT
Melosh too?

TF
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:05pm PDT

Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:05pm PDT
ahaha
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:05pm PDT
idk what's happening
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:05pm PDT
so many teachers are leaving this year -- brady, melosh, ekeruo, etc
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:04pm PDT
Rip c/o 2018
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:04pm PDT
licht is one of the smartest teachers in the school tbh
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:04pm PDT
he probably thinks an integral is instantaneous slope of the line
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:04pm PDT
honestly i doubt he even knows calculus
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:04pm PDT
loll that's exactly what i've heard -- he's getting promoted to physics c & there will be new teachers for 1
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:03pm PDT
Don’t tell me Ben is teaching it
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:03pm PDT
He’s like the only qualifying teacher in the entire school to teach physics c lol
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:03pm PDT
WTF
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:03pm PDT
did you know he's not going to be teaching physics c next year?
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:02pm PDT
honestly i'm still scared of being alone w/ licht in the hallway
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:02pm PDT
haha yes at least ppl won't be asking us hard questions in front of the class & putting us on the spot
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:02pm PDT
Honestly that’s a lot better than presenting lol
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:02pm PDT
I see
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:01pm PDT
at least this is what i understood from his explanation
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:01pm PDT
so he's not going to talk to us until then formally
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:01pm PDT
licht does the oral defense on thursday for our group i believe
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:01pm PDT
so basically, in class, we're going to be wandering around / standing by our poster & talking to students & answering questions
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:00pm PDT
And we are just presenting to him?
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:00pm PDT
True
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:00pm PDT
lol i wasn't sure. i knew it was this week but... oh well, we'll definitely have the parts on by class tmrw so it should be fine :) at least we won't be presenting tmrw
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 11:00pm PDT
But yeah
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 10:59pm PDT
I saw you said previously we had to have the poster ready by Monday so I thought he was gonna check on monday
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 10:59pm PDT
i don't think the poster is due monday? do you know?
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 10:58pm PDT
According to the final project schedule sheet, the poster needs to be ready by tuesday right? i have the poster at home rn and will be gluing my stuff on tonight so i'll remember to bring it tmrw
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 10:58pm PDT
I can just bring the material and glue it on tmr
Sunday, June 4, 2017 at 10:57pm PDT
Do you have the poster ready?
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 9:45am PDT
I have 2 projects with my groups today
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 9:44am PDT
Do you think we can do it tmr?
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 9:44am PDT
Same
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 9:42am PDT
when you're done revising your materials, lmk so you can come over and put them on the poster (i'll send you pics, dimensions of a drawn out plan to see how big to make each explanation before that)
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 9:41am PDT
sorry about the photoshop thing but i have to save time on my part bc i have like 5 projects this weekend
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 9:40am PDT
hey! because we have to have the poster ready by monday, my parents are getting a trifold to simplify the process so we can just glue the materials down
Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 8:05am PDT
i have an outline of the poster (if you didn't get a chance to do the photoshop) and my materials
Thursday, June 1, 2017 at 8:05am PDT
shuai! remember to print your parts of the poster materials (the stuff you wrote) before 4th period
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:39pm PDT
Let's just put the content on the doc
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:39pm PDT
 
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:39pm PDT
Yeah I'll take care of it
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:39pm PDT
i'll be relying on you for that bc i don't get photoshop & stuff
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:38pm PDT
ok!
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:38pm PDT
The layout would just be like a draft that we can show him tmr
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:38pm PDT
here's the link: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zyVP9VI4_Oq8Z7T-ccxYvWlWtCrnYUAtatTyOhrkr8A/edit?usp=sharing
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:38pm PDT
cuz I don't have a poster paper rn
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:22pm PDT
fyi i'll be on fb until 9-10 working on the doc so i'll probably answer immediately :D
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:21pm PDT
also, sorry for being late! is there anything in particular you wanted to talk about?
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:20pm PDT
idk i thought an old-fashioned normal poster would be less work..
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:20pm PDT
um if you think you can make one big enough to fit all the info we'll put on the doc, you're welcome to. can you show me a pic of your layout before we put anything on it?
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:08pm PDT
Of the poster
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:08pm PDT
I think we can just make a layout on Photoshop
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 5:05pm PDT
Hey Lily
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 11:47pm PDT
5 sounds ok to me
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 11:46pm PDT
Yeah that's right
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 11:46pm PDT
oh yeah, we'll also have to do something about the poster
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 11:45pm PDT
hope he doesn't ask too many hard questions at the check in :/
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 11:45pm PDT
wow i just went severely off topic
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 11:45pm PDT
idk i just picked it bc it's on the threshold of afternoon & twilight
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 11:44pm PDT

Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 11:44pm PDT
Afternoon*
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 11:44pm PDT

Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 11:43pm PDT
Yeah that'd be good
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 11:43pm PDT
anytime tmrw is ok w/ me
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 11:43pm PDT

Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 11:42pm PDT
ohh sorry i thought you were talking about the final presentation, not the 1/2 way check in
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 10:19pm PDT
Do you think we can just do it online?
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 10:18pm PDT
But the check in is on Thursday
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 10:18pm PDT
Same
Tuesday, May 30, 2017 at 10:18pm PDT

Monday, May 29, 2017 at 2:04pm PDT
Okay sounds good
Monday, May 29, 2017 at 1:42pm PDT
:'( why does physics c do this to us
Monday, May 29, 2017 at 1:42pm PDT
i'll be working on the poster materials tonight so we can print our own parts & show them to licht on thursday (he's checking on block i think according to the email)
Monday, May 29, 2017 at 1:41pm PDT
hi shuai!!! so about the presentation time slots (bc i won't be there tmrw -- apes field trip to pigeon point yayyy) just sign up for whatever you think is best (just pls don't pick last or first haha)
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 12:29pm PDT
I feel you cuz I'm inundated l
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 12:29pm PDT
It's okay 👌
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:55am PDT
either way, i'm apologizing again (i thought we would have time to go over what the action plan was last night / today but i didn't know you'd actually end up going and i'm so sorry about that)
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:54am PDT
honestly, i'm probably going to have to stay up forever tonight bc there's too much stuff due tmrw so i'm not sure exactly when we can work in the physics (i'll bring notes, 4 things i've learned and the textbook though, and i'll even print out a website and list of resources so you can bring your own materials as well and we'll combine them)
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 11:53am PDT
omg shuai i just saw this. i was working on a different project and i didn't know we were still doing the library thing after yesterday bc i thought we were just going to print the website :( i'm so sorry for not clarifying
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 10:07am PDT
I'll just go to Fremont main
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 10:07am PDT
The gate is closed
Sunday, May 21, 2017 at 10:06am PDT
Cuz I'm at school rn

that's actually great! you can print out a website (like maybe a proof or slideshow presentation from a university would be amazing) and i'll bring my book & we'll be set
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 5:30pm PDT
Thx
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 5:30pm PDT
Last year I just printed out the websites I used
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 5:30pm PDT
wait, i'll send you the sheet too

is 10 in the morning ok w/ you? lol idk what licht meant by "show me the resources" but i'm gonna play it safe & assume he meant books. i mean, you could print something out and show him but i don't know what he'd think...
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 5:29pm PDT
Oh and I don't have the sheet either
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 5:29pm PDT
So for the sources do we have to use books (cuz I don't have any)
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 5:28pm PDT
Sure let's meet up tmr some time
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 5:01pm PDT
we should definitely go to the library together if you're free to do that
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 5:01pm PDT
we need at least 2 so if you can bring a book that would be great
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 5:01pm PDT
in terms of resources to bring, i have a textbook so that makes 1
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 4:59pm PDT
we can even meet up at the library at some point to discuss & clarify our knowledge so when licht quizzes us monday, we know what we're doing (10% yo)
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 4:59pm PDT
i won't be working on physics most of this evening bc i have a stats presentation on monday and econ video lyrics due tuesday, but all of tmrw i'll be communicating w/ you about this
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 4:58pm PDT
the first image has the topics we should cover ranked in order of importance (we can add / take away as needed) and the second is just supplementary to understand the schwartzchild radius (not necessarily in presentation)
Saturday, May 20, 2017 at 4:57pm PDT
hey Shuai! i rewrote these bc i remember we turned in our work to licht on thursday i believe

Wednesday, May 17, 2017 at 2:53pm PDT
I forgot about this because my class let out early. Sorry about that! if i show up early tmrw (7:15-7:20) do you think you could get the packet to me in the morning?
Wednesday, May 17, 2017 at 2:06pm PDT
Sure! I'll be in the rotunda next to the Student Activity Center (you know where that is, right?) lol i didn't know where the SAC was until junior year

Hi Shuai! So our topic for the physics project is general relativity and applications to black holes (e.g Schwartzchild radius, etc.). Are you ok with that?

the OVA kinda had some evidence... ish? i think at least b/c i know someone who ships eruri & she always cites that one shot w/ erwin looking @ levi w/ admiration (?) as their anime basis for a relationship
Monday, March 27, 2017 at 9:44pm PDT
isayama implied that levi x erwin is canon? like idk the exact things off the top of my head, but apparently in the manga there is strong evidence that implies levi and erwin are together
Monday, March 27, 2017 at 9:44pm PDT
but actually
Monday, March 27, 2017 at 9:44pm PDT
i think the only canon couple in attack on titan is christa x ymir

omg nooooo not marco :( i kind of ship marco/jean by default but i'm not sure of the canon basis of it (do you know if there's any from the manga?)

lol so I started out w/ an 1860 I think back in 8th grade and my final SAT score was 2380 so yes, I would say it helped :D
Wednesday, April 5, 2017 at 9:46pm PDT
oh nice did it help?
Monday, April 3, 2017 at 5:49pm PDT
Yes, I went to Elite, particularly their SAT 2100 program. I believe it's now called SAT 1400 because the new SAT is out of 1600. :)

Hey Kathryn, is there any way I can get another partner for teaching composting tomorrow? Chrish didn't show up today, although she did warn me that her teacher might not let her go. I don't think her teacher will let her come tomorrow either.
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 3:11pm PDT
Hey Lily! Would you be willing to be our service accountant again next year? We forgot to put that option on the officer application...

Sunday, February 7, 2016 at 5:57pm PST
Yes, on 202, other than "Oglethorpanini" we had X518: 1-5 (+wobs in class). 205 included NW + D573:1, 2 + X578: 1-13 odd (+nobs in class). On 203 and 204, there were only worksheets.
Sunday, February 7, 2016 at 4:08pm PST
Do you know if there was homework from Tuesday-Friday other than the worksheets?
Friday, January 29, 2016 at 9:11pm PST
I've created it :) , although I think I put too many dates. Oh, and I'm sorry for not asking earlier, but do you have the sort hours from last week, because I have all of the collect but I don't have the sort packet?
Friday, January 29, 2016 at 6:55pm PST
I would recommend starting a new spreadsheet. 😊 Can you please share it with Denise & me? Thanks!
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 11:10pm PST
For the Recycling hours, should I/you start a new spreadsheet because of semester two, or should I just add to the previous spreadsheet?
Sunday, January 24, 2016 at 10:39pm PST
No problem! 😊
Sunday, January 24, 2016 at 10:24pm PST

I don't think they exist. And no problem whatsoever! Thank you so much for taking care of all the assignments recently. You're amazing. 😊 <3

Also, thank you so much for helping with the service hours last week! I apologize for forgetting to ask for the Sort hours.

Kathryn, I'm so sorry for not seeing/replying to these earlier messages, but for Melosh, do you know what the 1/21 and 1/22 assignments are? I didn't see them on the board, so I'm wondering if they exist or if they will be collected on Monday.
Wednesday, January 13, 2016 at 11:58pm PST
Don't forget the sign-in sheets tomorrow! :)
Monday, January 4, 2016 at 3:03am PST

Oh dear. I should check.
Wednesday, December 2, 2015 at 9:26pm PST

It's totally fine! I've been using it to unwind on Fridays. 😉 I can bring you the sheets in calculus tomorrow.
Thursday, November 5, 2015 at 8:11pm PST
Hey, Kathryn, for the hours spreadsheets, is there any way I can obtain the sign up sheets so I can enter in the hours? I'm so sorry you had to do what should have been my duty previously.

What was the 1013 Melosh homework? I took a photo of what it was originally, but I think he changed it later in the week, since what I wrote down Friday is different.

Monday, September 19, 2016 at 9:15pm PDT
Though I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to come because I'm not sure what my read teacher is going to say
Monday, September 19, 2016 at 9:13pm PDT
We can split the slides
Monday, September 19, 2016 at 9:10pm PDT

Monday, September 19, 2016 at 5:17pm PDT
hey chrish, so apparently, we're composting education partners & tmrw we're going to ciz's classroom to present. do you want to go over the slides/divide what we have to present and just go over what exactly we have to do? also, i don't have candy at home unfortunately :/

Would it be alright if you messaged me when you finished your part so that you could help me with the warrant and then after that like you said we can review it and do a mini presentation
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 8:07pm PST
haha yeah. maybe we can change that later
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 8:06pm PST
after all, we're supposed to be stuffy book-lovers lol
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 8:06pm PST
Ok, I guess we can deal with them later. After I finish writing my reason, we can comb through everything, make sure things are similarly set up, and perhaps replace some with stills. idk, I felt like the one on the last slide is funny, but considering gialdini will see it too, I don't think we should completely take away the seriousness from our presentation
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 8:04pm PST
Hmm... I didn't think about that at first. But yeah i just quickly went through the presentation and I think you're right. The gifs are taking too much attention away which will make it harder fro the audience to concentrate on what we're saying as they will most likely be paying attention to the gifs
Wednesday, March 9, 2016 at 8:01pm PST
hey Chrish, on the presentation, do you think gialdini will be ok with the gifs? bc they're kind of hurting my eyes, so i'm wondering if people would be irritated by constant movement when we're presenting
Monday, February 29, 2016 at 6:13pm PST
Yes we should. Sorry you were still typing for a while before so I didn't respond. But if you'd like to create the google doc my email is captainchrishhook@gmail.com

btw, we probably should get a google doc for the speech and stuff so that everything's in one place
Monday, February 29, 2016 at 5:18pm PST
Actually, Amanda did it for us yesterday. So we're Con side, arguing that books are better than their movie adaptations and we're going to split the speech equally based on reasons supporting the Toulmin claim.

I asked Johnson and he said we're basically creating a website that "contains content from newspaper and polls." Basically, we don't support any candidate. We have to collaborate with each newspaper/poll/media group.

wow i can't believe so many ppl are interested in a video game
Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 10:22pm PDT

The End. Everyone dies. No one is happy.

This is why the Doctor is known as Doctor Who. It is said that as Vader was dying, he gasped, "Doctor, why?" but the Master heard "Doctor Who?"
Wednesday, August 20, 2014 at 1:22pm PDT
The War Doctor killed Darth Vader and gained the title of "Who."
Wednesday, August 20, 2014 at 1:21pm PDT
Unfortunately, Foreman's full body radiation idea enervated Padme's immune system, and she and her child eventually died, causing Luke and Leah to never be born and Darth Vader to never be defeated.

Hannibal decided to use quid pro quo to blackmail House until Cuddy forced him to take the case.
Wednesday, August 20, 2014 at 1:18pm PDT
One day, the doctor and the Master stole a Tardis and flew far, far away, until they met a young Jedi Padawan. However, Padme was sick and another doctor (his name was House) refused to diagnose her because she wasn't interesting.
Wednesday, August 20, 2014 at 1:16pm PDT
Once upon a time, there was a doctor. He got teased all the time on Gallifrey because he didn't have a name. His best friend was the Master.

Oh and when are you going to go into your dorm? 😃
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 10:56am PDT
I am doing online classes for drivers ed right now XD and hopefully will finish by the end of summer
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 10:55am PDT
When are you going to get your license?
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 10:55am PDT
Currently there are not tv shows that I am obsessed with since Sherlock ended 😞 but my mom watches a lot of British shows so I just tag along 😆. We are watching Father Brown. It's about a priest who solves murder mysteries. It's nothing like Sherlock, just good humored fun
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 10:52am PDT
As for music, it's been a really long time since I had piano lessons (I stopped in 8th grade). So at this point I am just learning theme songs on my own. Usually if I hear a song from a movie I like, I'll try to find sheet music for it online 😆. Right now I am trying to learn the theme song from Studio Ghibli's Howl's Moving Castle 😊
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 10:50am PDT
Hahahaha. Honestly I think my love for nature is just from the many hikes my parents took me on. We have been basically hiking every weekend since middle school. It's just that during junior year I had so much notes to do, we couldn't hike on weekends anymore.
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 1:06am PDT
any new tv shows you're obsessed w? :D
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 1:05am PDT
how is life for you rn?
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 1:05am PDT
lol i'm supposed to be sleeping in preparation for driving lessons tmrw but night owl, you know? ;D
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 1:04am PDT
:/ no i haven't and this reminds me that i should before i get spoiled by reading analyses
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 1:04am PDT
haha i sound like a psychiatrist
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 1:04am PDT
hahaha i can't play the piano v well so general music suggestions are great! idk i always this music and book recommendations help me get to know a person (their likes / dislikes / etc.) in a more indirect way than asking blunt questions
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 1:02am PDT
Wow! That sounds amazing and fun :) is that where your love of nature comes from? lol when i was in elementary school, all i remember is studying a lot of math and playing hot lava monster on the playground (when the first time you go hiking besides science camp is in apes loll)
Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 1:35pm PDT
Oh and did you watch Sherlock yet? 😃
Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 1:35pm PDT
And for music do you mean like sheet music or like song suggestions?
Wednesday, June 21, 2017 at 1:34pm PDT
The summer camp is at Tule Ponds and is held by the Math Science Nucleus. I used to attend their camps back when I was in elementary school. Now that I am too old I just help watch the kids and do science activities with them
Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 9:48pm PDT
also do you have any music recommendations? i'm very bored and i feel like i should be doing something with my life
Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 9:48pm PDT
That sounds exciting! :D what kind of summer camp? are you going to be a camp counselor or something?
Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 9:46pm PDT
Same honestly :) although I've been able to read more books than I expected. Do you have a Goodreads account? I have this pledge to read 52 books this year and I'm 12 books behind haha (lol my update). I recommend "Tender is the Night" by F. Scott Fitzgerald if you have the time!
Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:38pm PDT
Though next week I will have to go volunteer at my old summer camp
Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:38pm PDT
My summer has been uneventful. Just being lazy 😆
Sunday, June 18, 2017 at 8:37pm PDT
Haha. I'm sure you will make new friends at Cal!
Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 10:23pm PDT
How has your summer been so far?
Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 10:23pm PDT
Thanks so much Athena! :)) pls visit me at Cal or I'll be lonely haha and also if you need any advice (or anything) don't hesitate to ask!
Saturday, June 17, 2017 at 8:53pm PDT
Congrats on graduating Lily! I know you will do well in Berkeley you smart girl! 😃❤️

Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:04pm PDT
they're very close to each other
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:04pm PDT
i'm ok w/ that as long as we don't repeat the same thing? i'll do the connection to the conflict so you can just analyze the placement of the words
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:04pm PDT
that pop out
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:04pm PDT
is just nice phrases and words
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:03pm PDT

Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:03pm PDT
can
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:03pm PDT
no i think we cna share that slide
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:02pm PDT

Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:02pm PDT

Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:02pm PDT
wait... so what exactly was your slide with all the words for? i just want to get this straightened out bc i need to know what else to add so we don't miss anything
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:00pm PDT
we can pick each other back up
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:00pm PDT
so if we mess up
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:00pm PDT

Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:00pm PDT
i think we both know the peom
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:00pm PDT

Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 10:00pm PDT
i'm confused rn
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:59pm PDT
the pictures were meant for the figures. i was going to use rosebuds to symbolize literal/figurative virgins, old time as the image, and the sunrise/sunset life analogy
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:59pm PDT
hmm what else
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:59pm PDT
if u want me to present sure
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:59pm PDT
ii dont think i was doing figures
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:58pm PDT

Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:57pm PDT

Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:55pm PDT
yes go for it
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:55pm PDT
but i just have one question
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:55pm PDT
if that's what you're going to say & ppt has everything you need, that's great!
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:55pm PDT
looks good :) ok so you have: conflict, subject, speaker, rhythm, words in that order (or you can switch it up if you want)
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:54pm PDT
the ppt is just an outline i believe
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:54pm PDT
ive*
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:54pm PDT
i ve meorized what i need to say
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 9:54pm PDT

sorry kishoree i'm going to ruin our presentation tmrw :((( oh well, i guess we can just practice our parts individually & meet for like 1-2 mins after we get to the classroom.
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 5:24pm PDT
we just need to finish today
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 5:24pm PDT
That's better honestly
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 5:20pm PDT
we can just be productive on the doc itself
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 5:19pm PDT
we don't need to hangouts
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 4:32pm PDT
i'll be there but i won't be able to stay for long. my parents are gonna kill me if i don't finish my college apps by 8 so i'm probably going to be multitasking during the hangout. i'm going to prep more after 10 and stuff but i don't expect you to delay anything for that and i'm so sorry :/ tbh i should have done those apps before
Tuesday, November 1, 2016 at 1:43pm PDT
hey LilY! let's hangout chat around 5PM
Monday, October 31, 2016 at 4:16pm PDT

Monday, October 31, 2016 at 4:14pm PDT

Monday, October 31, 2016 at 4:14pm PDT
bc i feel like we should prepare together at least once
Monday, October 31, 2016 at 4:14pm PDT
like maybe during lunch/after school?
Monday, October 31, 2016 at 4:14pm PDT
kish i'm going to work on the project late so dw if i don't show up until 9 or something (i'll still finish my part) but do you think you'll have time to meet up tmrw or something?

Thursday, October 27, 2016 at 3:54pm PDT

thanks! sorry for not being there today. and also i think your idea of connecting "to the virgins" to daily life is good (we should definitely start our presentation w/ that - idk i was thinking powerpoint but if you have a better idea we can go with that)
Wednesday, October 26, 2016 at 6:36pm PDT

by the way, are you ok with peer editing my personal statement essay on friday? river said we should get someone whom we trust haha
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 4:17pm PDT
wow omg what a wall of text. sorry
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 4:16pm PDT
Hi Kishoree :) haha actually mr. river didn't really say much about it anyway other than that we'll meet with our lit circle every week (i think it was tuesday - he'll probably say it in class again later) and discuss the book. the first time, we're going to create a reading schedule and i'm pretty sure we're going to have to present in front of the class eventually. rn you don't really have to do anything for it except get the book by nov 1 (btw if you haven't bought it yet, get the penguin edition :D i have it too & i think others will get it bc it's rated well and it'd be great if our group had the same book for pg # references)
Tuesday, October 18, 2016 at 2:44pm PDT
Hey Lily! I believe you're in my Lit circle- Jane Eyre. Can you please explain what we have to do for it? I was absent on Friday and no one really explained it to me. Thank you󾌵

Tuesday, December 29, 2015 at 4:28pm PST
Hi Kishoree! Merry Christmas to you as well. What you wrote looks like either an antithesis or a juxtaposition (an antithesis of phrases, which would be a specific type of juxtaposition), but either way, I think it would be a scheme.
Friday, December 25, 2015 at 4:08pm PST
please help!!
Friday, December 25, 2015 at 4:07pm PST

Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:57pm PDT
OH true whoops
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:57pm PDT
ASIMOV
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:57pm PDT
DEFINITELY
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:57pm PDT
aha i think it's synopses or something
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:57pm PDT
READ THEM NOW they are amazing! :D do you read sci-fi in general though?
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:57pm PDT
however you pluralize "synopsis"
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:56pm PDT
there's so many of them in that series!!! although they all look extremely interesting, i got an actual headache from reading all the synopsises of them
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:55pm PDT
it's kind of a tradition, a sci-fi book for my birthday every year
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:55pm PDT
ikr! i've gotten one for every b-day :)
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:55pm PDT
XD
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:55pm PDT
that's a LOT of books
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:55pm PDT

Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:53pm PDT
yesss but it'll whip us into shape!
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:53pm PDT
also, one preplanned example that always works: Ender's Game lol
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:53pm PDT
yeah i remember being super nervous about my score and then him telling us that he was extremely strict bc that made me feel relieved :)
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:52pm PDT
because on joon's scale, a 9/10 is practically a 12
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:52pm PDT
so he doesn't give 12's
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:52pm PDT
way stricter than collegeboard on essays
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:52pm PDT
ahah joon is super strict
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:51pm PDT
time limit ughhhh joon said to just have lots of preplanned examples that you can always reuse
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:51pm PDT
actually i'm going to watch YOU get a 12 :)
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:51pm PDT
lolllll i wish. i'm really bad at the essay bc of the time limit.
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:50pm PDT
imma watch you get a 9 or 10 and blow everyone out of the water
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:50pm PDT
YOU ARE LILY
Tuesday, August 4, 2015 at 11:50pm PDT
NOT POSSIBLE

Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:25pm PDT

Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:23pm PDT
we play games occasionally
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:23pm PDT
willie seems like he actually cares
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:23pm PDT
and Edmund seemed a bit tired toward the end
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:23pm PDT
in my opinion haha
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:22pm PDT
He explains much better than Edmund
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:21pm PDT
is he like edmund? like in terms of explaining math?
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:21pm PDT
for some reason
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:21pm PDT

Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:20pm PDT

Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:20pm PDT

Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:17pm PDT
i'll never forget it
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:17pm PDT
the phenomenon thing tho
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:16pm PDT
although he is kind of... different
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:16pm PDT
awww it's all right i always space out on at least one crit reading section and thuan's never called me out
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:14pm PDT
And I was terrified Thuan would call me out because he's Thuan
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:13pm PDT
so I ended up missing 5 entire questions just for that passage
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:13pm PDT
Ugh last week wasn't into it I guess so I didn't properly comprehend one passage
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:13pm PDT
but i got an A in gialdini lol somehow i feel as though i don't deserve my grade now
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:12pm PDT
it's funny, i get terrible grades on sat writing
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:12pm PDT
but i kinda deserve it for my horrible writing
Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:12pm PDT

Monday, August 3, 2015 at 10:12pm PDT

CRIES
Sunday, March 22, 2015 at 4:09pm PDT

Sunday, March 22, 2015 at 4:08pm PDT
i thought i did the best on disease detectvies
Sunday, March 22, 2015 at 4:08pm PDT
yes, but the 3 minutes rule was weird and i think we got 10th bc of your great guessing skills lol
Sunday, March 22, 2015 at 4:08pm PDT

you must have been amazing :)
Sunday, March 22, 2015 at 4:08pm PDT
if we put our heads into it and studied more (cries) we could probably rank a lot higher
Sunday, March 22, 2015 at 4:07pm PDT
but, GJ
Sunday, March 22, 2015 at 4:07pm PDT
yes, that was actually way better than what i thought we would get. ironically, the one i studied the most for (compound machines) we failed bc our machine couldn't measure the ratios in 4 min :'(
Sunday, March 22, 2015 at 4:07pm PDT
THAT'S ACTUALLY REALLY GOOD
Sunday, March 22, 2015 at 4:06pm PDT
BUT WE GOT 10TH
Sunday, March 22, 2015 at 4:06pm PDT
we just didn't get enought time to study
Sunday, March 22, 2015 at 4:06pm PDT
<3
Sunday, March 22, 2015 at 4:06pm PDT

Friday, March 20, 2015 at 9:29pm PDT

Friday, March 20, 2015 at 9:28pm PDT

Friday, March 20, 2015 at 9:27pm PDT

Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:21pm PDT
 
Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:21pm PDT
at least it's not a build event
Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:21pm PDT
think on the bright side
Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:20pm PDT
i realize cramming doesn't work on this

Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:20pm PDT

Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:18pm PDT

Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:18pm PDT

Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:16pm PDT
true
Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:16pm PDT
I was just bringing the subject up bc we'll have to do something before the competition right?
Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:16pm PDT
No, it doesn't have to be now if you're busy.
Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:15pm PDT
uhhh
Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:15pm PDT
now?
Thursday, March 19, 2015 at 10:13pm PDT
Juliana! Want to take a Dynamic Planet practice test?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:57pm PDT
^_^
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:57pm PDT
byeeee
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:57pm PDT
nah you math genius
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:57pm PDT
but yeah bye!
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:56pm PDT
:(
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:56pm PDT
gl on the french thingy i was never good at spanish personally
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:56pm PDT
see ya!
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:56pm PDT
:) see you tmrw at lunch
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:56pm PDT
okay sure :)
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:56pm PDT
so i'll keep fb open, but do you want to go study for that french test? it's ok if you don't finish notes by tmrw but i don't have a test so i'll take notes
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:55pm PDT
aw lily
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:55pm PDT
aha yes we need to be confident. i'm sure we'll make it though
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:55pm PDT
i'm sure you're a french genius too!
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:55pm PDT
thanks! we got this!!
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:54pm PDT
oh you'll be all right
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:54pm PDT
oh geez good luck! :)
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:54pm PDT
cries
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:54pm PDT
and we're both so busy
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:54pm PDT
it's all right! i probably won't finish either, but i'll get as much done as possible (probably halfway)
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:54pm PDT
i have a national french test tomorrow so gotta study too
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:54pm PDT
exactly
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:54pm PDT
same, although i don't hink i will be finished for sure
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:54pm PDT
we still have a couple of days so no stress but we shouldn't slack either
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:53pm PDT
yup ok i'll def use this method. it seems very efficient. i'll bring the notes i manage to take by tomorrow.
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:53pm PDT
it's just that wiki is fast and convenient considering our time crunch
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:52pm PDT
we can double check if needed
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:52pm PDT
even if people say they aren't reliable
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:52pm PDT
yes!
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:52pm PDT
idk but do you think we should use wikipedia articles though?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:51pm PDT
sure
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:51pm PDT
yeah that's actually a much better method
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:51pm PDT
using the textbooks as well as other resources if needed
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:51pm PDT
okay so i think with so little time left instead of splitting the books based on chapter, we should just research our respective topics
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:50pm PDT
oh phew so if you want we could split the books and also the links based on the 6-6 method...
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:49pm PDT
oh wait the 315 one is the same as the 353 one my bad
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:48pm PDT
where'd you get the 315 pp one though
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:48pm PDT
ah it's alright
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:48pm PDT
so introduction to physical oceanography = 353 pp, lecture notes = 123 pp, introduction to descriptive physics oceanography = 27 pp, segar = 32 pp
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:48pm PDT
sorry caps
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:48pm PDT
OH I M JUST MISSING THAT 353 ONE
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:47pm PDT
because the ones i see are 313 AND 123
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:47pm PDT
wait now im confused which ones are you talking about specificLLY
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:46pm PDT
we can split them bc i'm finding it difficult to separate books for the topics
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:46pm PDT
and there are two mini-books 27 pages and 32 pages
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:46pm PDT
one 123 pg one
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:45pm PDT
there's one 353 pg textbook
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:45pm PDT
oh wait this is easier than i thought it would be
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:44pm PDT
hmm which textbooks would correspond
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:44pm PDT
so waves and down for me
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:43pm PDT
yupp
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:43pm PDT
all right, i'll do the last 6. we can do ocean tools together right?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:43pm PDT
you can take the last 6 except oceanic tools
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:42pm PDT
i can take the first 6
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:41pm PDT
uh
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:41pm PDT
same
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:41pm PDT
okay you can take whichever topics you want and i'll take the rest idc honestly
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:40pm PDT
yeha i think we should divide topics first and then textbooks
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:40pm PDT
k then we have segar, talley, lecture notes pdf, and introduction to physical oceanography for textbooks. which one do you want to do? we could do one each or share one...
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:39pm PDT
hehe
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:39pm PDT
oh yeah that looks familiar
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:39pm PDT
oh nice
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:39pm PDT
^this is a really good intro ppt
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:38pm PDT
http://www.miracosta.edu/home/kmeldahl/T&Toutlines/Ch01.pdf
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:38pm PDT
i was reading the segar one the other day
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:38pm PDT
gah i have 8 links and i don't remember :( but i remember like 3 of them are genuine textbooks
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:37pm PDT
do you rememebr which textbook that was exactly?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:36pm PDT
and we met in the library
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:36pm PDT
earlier when we decided to split that one etxtbook
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:36pm PDT
um
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:36pm PDT
yes!
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:36pm PDT
so i was thinking we could divide the textbooks?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:36pm PDT
true :(
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:35pm PDT
it's going to be station-based :\
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:35pm PDT
coastal features, oceanic tools, buoyancy
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:34pm PDT
waves, surface/coastal currents, high/low tides
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:34pm PDT
topographic features, tectonics,reefs
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:34pm PDT
seawater, energy inputs, water temp
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:33pm PDT
4 sheets of paper front/back w/notes of these:
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:33pm PDT
diane mailed everyone the rulebook but i looked and the requirements are:
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:33pm PDT
and we need to make sure of all the requirements for our event
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:32pm PDT
i feel like the links are more specialized
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:32pm PDT
i think the textbooks might be more thorough so if we run out of time we can just skim and learn teh basics at least
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:32pm PDT
lemme open them
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:31pm PDT
which one did we decide to concentrate on again?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:31pm PDT
oh you want to start with the textbook or the links?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:31pm PDT
textbook
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:31pm PDT
starting with the texstbok
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:31pm PDT
so
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:31pm PDT
we need to cram everything
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:31pm PDT
definitely
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:31pm PDT
but we should probs get to the studying part, yeah?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:31pm PDT
you don't have to. i know there's a lot of pressure freshman year and i honestly don't blame you.
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:30pm PDT
i feel really bad
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:30pm PDT
about the slacking part
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:30pm PDT
me too
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:30pm PDT
honestly though
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:29pm PDT
it's ok. i felt kind of awkward for a moment but that was it :\
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:29pm PDT
what why?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:29pm PDT
sorry for the late reply my dad was yelling at me
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:28pm PDT
i'll do 2 pages
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:28pm PDT
i'm taking notes on the last seven topics. if you need anything else, i guess you can ask me
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:26pm PDT
idk i'm sorry if i let you down :(
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:25pm PDT
but i think we can learn mostly everything before the competition
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:25pm PDT
i'm being honest, i sort of slacked on this event :(
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:25pm PDT
so i know we both didn't study super hard for this, right?
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:24pm PDT
aha thanks! but my english teacher says 98% of people pass anyway :)
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:24pm PDT
oh good luck!
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:24pm PDT
so i have the cahsee this week. so i don't think i'll have much work after school
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 6:23pm PDT

in the rules manual, there are 13 major topics. you can do the first 6 and i'll do the last 7 if you'd like. no - four sheets front and back - so 8 pages
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 4:40pm PDT
eah
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 4:40pm PDT
so just essentially four sides of notes
Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 4:40pm PDT

Sunday, March 15, 2015 at 4:39pm PDT

Juliana, would you like to meet at my/your house at some point in time? I'm busy every day after school with classes, and I have a bunch of club meetings, so it's a little unfeasible to meet at lunch or after school.
Tuesday, January 27, 2015 at 6:30pm PST
OH nono no need to apologize in fact i should actually be apologizing Sorry :/ but honestly yesss we need to meet up um im not sure maybe friday during lunch? how far are you on studying?

JULIANA ok I'm sorry I am definitely trying not to avoid you. Sorry about last week; I was sort of studying for finals and boycotting fb :\ anyway I'm back so tell me when you want to meet and I'll be there. I won't stand you up this time and sorry again about earlier :(

anyway, we shouldn't just talk about my flyers
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:48pm PST
haha thanks. I actually had to spend 5 hours improving it until Diane liked it. And you've see the final product
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:47pm PST
Its actually not bad, although the current one is an improvement. It looks really nice!!!!!!! :D
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 10:46pm PST

:) :)
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 6:10pm PST
cyaa
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 6:10pm PST
You're not a bother :) hey, at least you made me cheer up before I had to eviscerate my poor flyer again. haha thanks for the good luck. gl to you but i don't think you'll need it :)
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 6:02pm PST
oh of course sorry to be a bother and good luck! :)
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 6:01pm PST
wow, that makes you incredibly lucky :) anyway, is it okay if I talk to you later? Diane is sort of 'suggesting improvements' (in other words, pointing out various flaws) with my flyers, my poor, little flyers :( I need to improve them before she sends them out
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 5:57pm PST
nope cuz one of the essays is only a rough draft and the other is a "privacy journal" thing that counts more as an assignment than an essay XD but it is still technically an essay
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 5:55pm PST
wait but you still had to turn it in on turnitin, right?
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 5:55pm PST
YES
Wednesday, December 10, 2014 at 5:55pm PST

Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 11:39pm PST
okay, that's great! See you on Friday! :)
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 11:38pm PST
Haha yes sounds good
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 5:04pm PST
haha just writing it here so I don't forget. Also, should we read up a little of what's on the Dynamic Planet event so we can divide accurately?
Tuesday, December 9, 2014 at 5:03pm PST
so at the CAML today we were talking about meeting Friday after school in the library to divide the work
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:38pm PST
yeah toys for tots awh studying sucks cyaaa
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:33pm PST
I have to study (chem & math tests this week) :(
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:32pm PST
anyway, see you :)
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:32pm PST
oh French Club. You guys are doing toys for tots right?
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:31pm PST
until then, I think we should just focus on getting introduced to the competition style. Although I think Garima said she was putting study materials up. I can ask her about it.
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:30pm PST
sure, so whenever you want to meet, just let me know the day before
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:30pm PST
yes, I think we even get to take 4 double-sided note sheets so we need to read a lot to figure out what we're going to put on that
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:29pm PST
:)
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:29pm PST
we can discuss how we're going to meet up, make study deadlines, etc.
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:28pm PST
oh mrs howell oops XD and possibly. it's just useful to know where i can find you at school. i wont be able to meet tomorrow because i have french club, but maybe on wednesday
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:25pm PST
so do you plan on meeting during lunch?
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:25pm PST
ok that's great. haha no it's mrs. howell. And she's in room 523 (I have her right after lunch)
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:24pm PST
:) where is mr. howell's classroom? You can usually find me with a group of friends directly in front of the library doors.
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:22pm PST
that really depends from day to day but most of the time I'll be in front of howell's classroom (you'll know me if you see me eating a pb sandwich :) ) If I'm not there, I'll be near the flagpole in the front with a couple of friends. Where can I find you?
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:21pm PST
where can i usually find you at lunch?
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:21pm PST
okay sounds good
Monday, December 1, 2014 at 10:20pm PST
Okay sorry I haven't responded in so long. No, I haven't done scioly before so newbie just like you. I checked out the scioly wiki and there's some concrete stuff we need to know (like the Coriolis force) and the rest is just everything about oceanography I think?
Friday, November 28, 2014 at 2:33pm PST
Have you done science Olympiad before? I'm new to it, so to clarify, we just need to research anything and everything about the topic, right?
Thursday, November 27, 2014 at 11:10pm PST
So how would you like to start studying oceanography and whatnot? Dynamic Planet's a station based test so we need practical & theoretical skills.
Thursday, November 27, 2014 at 11:08pm PST
So... Hi Juliana! We're doing the scioly Dynamic Planet event together but you already know that.

BTW, ur handwriting is just like bradley hand ITC
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:28am PDT
and then it just feels lame to me that every dispute in a superhero movie is solved thru fighting
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:27am PDT
maybe this is me for every superhero movie, but during the climax fighting, it's hard for me to understand exactly what they're fighting for
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:27am PDT
wonder woman had some good stuff, but overall, the plot was lame
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:26am PDT
u might get triggered by things that are not physically possible, but just rmr that they have super strength & stuff
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:26am PDT
they're so strong in a non-showing off way
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:26am PDT
including the amazons, who are amazebeans <3 i've never seen anything like them before
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:25am PDT
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g-TKc6q_yFc okay, this shows some of the rly nice parts of the movie
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:21am PDT
future generations will just look at our curly handwriting & tears will well in their eyes as they look to the gods and whisper..."how...how do they do this...."
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:20am PDT
that means we totally have an advantage in calligraphy and stuff
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:20am PDT
npr had this story that cursive is dead & the school board is considering removing it
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:20am PDT
bc it's a waste to not write in cursive; like what was the point of learning it?
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:20am PDT
just me wanting to write faster & wanting to apply the cursive i learned
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:19am PDT
ah the story of how my handwriting developed is quite lazy
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:19am PDT
after that, wonder woman goes into the human world of world war ii & it's still impressive but less fun to watch her fighting against much weaker humans
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:19am PDT
in the beginning, there's this one scene on the beach of wonder woman's planet, and all the amazons are fighting against a human fleet & it's the best scene in the whole movie
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:18am PDT
i have to find a clip to show u
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:18am PDT
but wonder woman comes from this planet of amazons, which is a bunch of god-like women who have super strength, so the way they fight is so mesmerizing & like i've never seen before
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:17am PDT
ya natasha's good at fighting (i dont like her personality much, shes all stormy & boring), but she fights in a regular karate-spy way-- it's p basic
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:17am PDT
...i have a feeling ppl cross-over yoi & haikyuu a lot; it's kinda chaotic evil for u to make me find ur ao3 account with such cryptic info
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:16am PDT
i feel like u should have made the mouth more pursed so it looks like he's kissing the medal
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:16am PDT
i like that one! it's like all pointy like draco malfoy + legolas from lord of the rings + spock from star trek
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 9:15am PDT
ur sketch phase is a gift to the whole world <3
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:35am PDT
ahahahaha thanks for the compliment but i think your handwriting is like the lovechild of lucida handwriting and bradley hand ITC, both of which i love so i am jealous teach me your ways
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:34am PDT
omg i just noticed you wrote the same thing haha
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:33am PDT
idk watching natasha fight -- me wanting to get fit and badass like her
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:33am PDT
your comment about the fight scenes reminds me of captain america civil war which i watched for the first time today
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:32am PDT
AHHHH how could you do this to me jk :D how was wonder woman bad? expliqueme
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:32am PDT

Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:46pm PDT
oh my i love ur cute little signature next to the drawing
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:45pm PDT

awwww i love the husky dog <3 <3 not as much as a cat though hahaha bc today i saw a cat drinking out of the dripping hose and it made me feel sad (the owners didn't give her enough water?) and loving (it's a cat!! i'm just like sebastian from black butler)
Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 4:32pm PDT
OMG the biryani is so accurate though. whenever i see chicken biryani or when my mom makes it i basically start dancing (badly) and finish my hw 2x as fast as i would otherwise :) my sis really hates biryani on the other hand along w/ most indian food so she's an outlier (see what i did there? ekeruo should be proud of me)

Hi Michelle! So because we're on the tech team for sheHacks (by the way, I'm really sorry for not communicating with you earlier; that was irresponsible of me), I've created a repo for the website. Please let me know if you've already created one/started, but if you haven't, are you all right with giving me your github username so I can add you as a collaborator?

"A super PAC cannot contribute directly to a politician or political party, but it can spend independently to campaign for or against political figures."
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 10:11pm PST
it's against the definition of superPAC ad
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 10:11pm PST
oh no don't include that if amit's ad is supposed to be negative
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 10:10pm PST
you should put the disclaimer as a text box on the last clip
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 10:10pm PST
and you have to give a disclaimer that no candidate is sponsoring the ad
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 10:10pm PST
sure! a negative superPAC ad is that you can't say vote trump or don't vote hillary directly at the end, although you can imply that one is better than the other
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 9:30pm PST
Because Amit has a "vote Clinton" at the end so I'm not sure if I should 8nclude that
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 9:29pm PST
By the way can you explain what a super PAC negative ad has, I'm still a bit confused is it that I never mention anyone's names? Or not the one I support?
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 8:39pm PST
O Hahaha no im dying anyways
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 8:36pm PST

Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 12:29am PST
johnson didn't show our period
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 12:29am PST
OH haha i heard about this from bhavi too

Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 12:28am PST
https://www.shotcut.org
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 12:28am PST

Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 12:27am PST
U remember those ppl with the Bernie Sanders ads I need those ppl
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 12:27am PST

Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 12:26am PST
It's just that for some reason the videos aren't working in my windows movie maker so I tried to use YouTube's but tha t only works for one of the ads

Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 12:25am PST
SAME that's what i thought! i hope it's due friday bc i don't think it's reasonable to expect we'll finish editing 4 ads in 1 day :/
Thursday, November 17, 2016 at 12:24am PST
aAA I wish I saw this sooner yes I still have to do some but did Johnson also mention in your period that we could submit it to him by Friday too? He said it was better to do it by Thursday but
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 9:58pm PST
i'm so sorry for dumping this on you, but if you have any left hmu :)
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 9:58pm PST
SORRY :( i know i was planning to help and then i left you alone to do everything
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 9:57pm PST
also, just as a reminder: the disclaimer at the end of the negative superPAC ads that this isn't sponsored by any candidate
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
?
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 9:56pm PST
i should have mentioned this before, but are there any ads left that you haven't done
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 9:56pm PST

Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 9:55pm PST
omg kelly i am so sorry for not replying to this promptly
Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 9:15pm PST

Wednesday, November 16, 2016 at 5:20pm PST

LILLLLLLYLLYLLYLLYLLYLYLYL, For sheHacks, a team needs to have really good communication so if you aren't consistently checking your emails, text messages, or facebook, this is an issue. This is nothing personal but if you aren't able to reply to me tomorrow by 7pm, I'm going to have to give up your official position on the team. Instead, I will contact you for volunteer or mentor opportunities for sheHacks. - Areeta

Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 12:06pm PDT
obv i don't condone racism but ppl can be so obsessed w/ class rank... (which basically means nothing on the long run, esp considering it's just high school)

i'm actually coding sth right now! it's on project euler. if it works, i'll show it to you! :DD (show off haha)
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:58am PDT
i feel depressed that i've already forgotten most of what i've learned last school year though :/ like ap chem (electrochem, titration memories). the things that linger are calc, cs, and english, interestingly enough
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:57am PDT
omg also i tried a mocha frap at starbucks. i feel like an adult now loll (i only get frappuccinos anyway even though it's technically a coffee shop) and honestly the only size i know is tall
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:55am PDT
also today at the airport, i saw some ppl taking pics of the security guards and the checkpoint and i was really confused but their antics kind of made me laugh so life is actually p amusing.
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:54am PDT

HAPPY INDEPENDENCE DAY TO YOU TOO! (are you still in LA? go watch fireworks! i'm going to SF this afternoon / evening so i can go see them -- lol when you see TNT signs in the safeway parking lot and fireworks are supposed to be illegal in the vicinity)
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:50am PDT
THANK YOU FOR THE LUCK <3 (loll hopefully? my mom said she wants me to call her immediately after i get them so i'm constantly scared of disappointing my parents :/ ) i'm sure we'll both be fine though!
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:48am PDT
WOW that's actually so smart i didn't think about the ethics of making students code cal central! esp considering grades are displayed on the same website (i couldn't tell you knew little about websites; i feel like you know more than you think you do though :) )
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:45am PDT
:) i want to understand what you're talking about when you complain so it's in my best interests if i did do some research! also you're my only friend going to cal so you're v important haha! :/ but your major is v difficult (and useful) so i admire you for taking on the challenge! i think you once said it was the easiest engineering major to get into or sth but you're going to learn so much math! and theory! and everything there is to know about efficiency! so i'm excited for you (haha so many exclamation points.)
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:40am PDT
hey at least you're 45 minutes before me right? :DDD lmk if you get into all of your classes! i think cal central will crash by the time i get on it lollll
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:39am PDT
lol same though on being lazy. last time i went to india, internet wasn't readily available, so you could get this little flash drive thing (an MTS) that created a local hotspot (p expensive tho) but i didn't buy it bc i was sleeping 90% of the time (and worrying about my STAR test scores i believe? what is my life)
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:37am PDT
also, if you ever want to read a great translation of dante's divine comedy: http://www.gutenberg.org/files/8800/8800-h/8800-h.htm (it's less difficult to understand than i thought it was)
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:36am PDT
i just got my account and i'm too lazy to write reviews for every single one of my books
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:36am PDT
AHAHA i would definitely try them though :) (i don't think i wouldn't like them, there are v few books i don't like) but you have a goodreads account?! SAME! what's your username? (so i can stalk you lol)
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:34am PDT
:))) i <3 dogs too (although i wish i could talk to cats idk i've read too much kafka on the shore which i recommend). i just saw a beautiful dog at the airport (my mom's flight) and it was part of the k9 squad so i couldn't pet it :'(
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 11:33am PDT
:) a key logger is basically a piece of malware that registers all of the keystrokes (everything you type) if it's installed on your computer. some ppl use it for parental controls / workplace supervision, but generally, it can be used to steal passwords & infiltrate accounts! haha i am getting a computer before college wow how did you guess :D mainly bc intel & apple have collaborated to create a better processor so i thought it was about time
Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 12:22am PDT

Tuesday, July 4, 2017 at 12:21am PDT

Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:25pm PDT
^ me: oracle is the most incompetent consultant company cal could have picked; why don't they just ask students to revamp their website for work study credit / internships???

Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:22pm PDT
<3
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:21pm PDT
omg i always spam you on fb :) hopefully not bothering you too much (lmk if i am i know i can be pretty annoying!)
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:20pm PDT
:))))) HAHA i was more worried about you being (idk angry? disappointed? frustrated?) about me not responding? i feel guilty all the time. on the flip side, i tend not to have expectations of other ppl so you can respond whenever it's convenient for you
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:19pm PDT
i'm ok :D kind of worried (read: high anxiety at all moments, literally, me driving reminds me of static friction which reminds me of physics c whyyyyy) sorry for probably raising your test anxiety by extension
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:17pm PDT
:) SAME my driving teacher thinks i'm stupid now but yeah, if we can survive high school we should be able to learn how to drive
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:17pm PDT
wtf is stochastics lol good luck
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:16pm PDT
:))) you don't need to try so hard to do that! have a relaxing and great trip! if you're too busy, i'll meet up w/ you afterwards! also, we have 4 yrs at cal to complain about hard IEOR and EECS classes (IEOR doesn't sound like an easy major; i actually did some research)
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:15pm PDT
ahaha once i didn't use my phone for so long it automatically ran out of charge due to spontaneous circuits created with the environment (but yes, you are v correct & i will follow your advice)
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:14pm PDT
TY that makes me feel better :D i hate cal central so much. did you see it after the update today? try adding and enrolling your classes! the javascript error is disgusting lol i'll send you a screenshot
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:13pm PDT
mine is on 12:45 PM on jul 11!!! wbu? ik mine isn't that good of a time, hopefully yours is beforehand!
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:12pm PDT
my mom's going to india this year but the rest of my family isn't bc she's just trying to convert rupees to dollars (FOREX yay)
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:11pm PDT
OMG that sounds so cool! isn't fb blocked in china? idk maybe i'm misinformed but is that why you told me to contact thru email? (lol watch me draft essays and delete them bc i'm anxious)
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:10pm PDT
i am way too obsessed w/ google docs (but seriously, if you get the time, please list them! :) )
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:09pm PDT
:DDDDD RECOMMEND YOUR BOOKS HERE PLS (i want to read what you're reading): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1AE3luXZp8MzwbNnBCcsizYA_iwUJgnCcZP6kHWMcPOA/edit?usp=sharing
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:02pm PDT
*very off topic :D
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:02pm PDT
<3 thank you jessica. this is kind of off topic but do you like cats or dogs better? i feel like i've asked you a million times and you like dogs... but i'm so scatterbrained lol
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 3:00pm PDT
i was actually considering trying to find my scores early w/ a proxy server even though they often double as key loggers and my newfound lack of caring about the health of my computer makes me nervous (why am i like this) but enough about my shenanigans
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:57pm PDT
<3
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:57pm PDT
Anyways I'll text you soon!!

Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:54pm PDT
Awww thanks for keeping it on just for me lol that's very flattering =P don't forget to charge it lol
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:53pm PDT
But yes we're not supposed to be able to enroll yet
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:52pm PDT
You're supposed to have an appointment for enrollment already, but yeah I agree it is p broken
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:52pm PDT
I have also been eating and reading and I haven't been studying haha oops. Im currently in LA and will leave for China in a week haha so uh you'll have to email me soon to contact me instead haha
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:51pm PDT
=(( well I hope that you feel better about whatever is making you feel off
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:50pm PDT
Aww =(( don't worry too much I know that your AP scores are amazing !!!
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:50pm PDT
HI LILYYYY
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:47pm PDT
you know, the prospect of talking to ppl always stresses me out but when i actually start doing it, it's relieving? i'm confused about the way my personality works loll and this is another veiled apology haha (i didn't mean to give you the impression you were being ignored, i was just being weird and panicky)
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:45pm PDT
hmmm maybe ∞th
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:45pm PDT
that's not a word
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:44pm PDT

Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:44pm PDT

Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:44pm PDT

Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:43pm PDT
on another note, my dad let me drive today and i almost crashed into a tree. good times ://
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:42pm PDT
AHHHH you were free & i didn't check my fb so i couldn't officially invite you :/ well, it's fourth of july break now so i don't expect you to be free anymore, but if you are and still want to visit / meet, text! i'll be more diligent with my checking and stop lazing about
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:41pm PDT
i'll keep it on just for you :))))
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:40pm PDT
loll sure :))) i rarely check my phone (it's off right now) and i don't even know my phone number (i have myself in my contacts haha) but here it is -- (510)-362-8946
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:39pm PDT
my parents keep yelling at me about berkeley bc cal central is p much broken (idk but we're not supposed to be able to enroll in classes / sign up for enrollment appointments yet right?) -- they want me to contact the department directly but this seems way too trivial to be worried about...
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:37pm PDT
but what have you been doing? hopefully something more fun :DDD
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:37pm PDT
haha most of what i've been doing recently is reading, studying, and sleeping at 2 am and also procrastinating on replying to messages (mainly bc i want everything to be perfect or bc the smallest thing can make me feel off nowadays)
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:35pm PDT
i always do this
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:35pm PDT
i'm so sorry :'(
Monday, July 3, 2017 at 1:35pm PDT
JESSICA HIIII haha i've been pretty much dead for the past couple of days (actually weeks :( if you ask my parents, all i talk about anymore is ap scores)
Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 9:30pm PDT
altho i feel like i can probably find it somewhere...
Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 9:30pm PDT
bc u dont check facebook that often lol
Saturday, July 1, 2017 at 9:29pm PDT

Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:34am PDT
Good night =))
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:34am PDT
How is late night at foothill? And lol I'm hungry rn too haha
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:34am PDT
I mean, I know you will =)
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:34am PDT
=(( hopefully we'll do well
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:33am PDT
"P deadly" welp I'm going to die then
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:33am PDT
Ohh that would make sense. Haha yeah I'm really hoping I do pass <3 thanks for the reassurance
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:32am PDT
=(( from what I've heard Berkeley is more unique with its registration process, because most of the other schools (including UCs) have you enroll for classes during orientation (most likely after they've talked to an advisor)
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:31am PDT
I don't have a bucket list, but if be down to join you at sunset!! Sounds like fun
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:31am PDT
I'm free a few days this upcoming week!! And I'm definitely interested in sharing music, tv show, book etc interests, altho I might not know most of what you like oops
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:29am PDT
Lily?? A showoff?? Nahh
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:29am PDT
I like the colors and shading lol teach me
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:29am PDT
Oooh!!!! I like it haha =))
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:28am PDT
Ooh I didn't know about the art classes! That's really cool =)) and lol I've never actually heard you don't before tho so who knows =)) you're prob great
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:27am PDT
good night <3
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:26am PDT
jk :D
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:26am PDT
HELPPP JESSICAUUU
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:26am PDT
i can't believe i'm hungry rn this is bad
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:26am PDT
but i keep looking at blogs about late night at foothill
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:26am PDT
we'll both have super hard math classes in the fall :'( not looking forward to this
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:25am PDT
but yeah math 1b (which you'd take if you skipped) is p deadly :(( i do not envy you lolll
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:24am PDT
YES! wow that's a relief. UC's really don't hold your hand thru the class registration process :( hmmm they're probably delaying you for eng 7 bc of the math 1a prereq / concurrent but i'm sure you'll get over a 3 for sure on the exam! (you deserve a 5, or a 4 at least imo)
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:21am PDT
one day i'm going to visit forest park at sunset. it's on my bucket list. do you have one? what's on yours?
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:21am PDT
haha when are you free? i wanna know more about your taste in music, tv shows, books, etc :) also i'm super late when checking fb messages all the time so if you're really interested~~
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:18am PDT
hands are soooooo hard :/// it took me 5 hrs (haha i'm boasting now but that's just bc i'm a showoff)
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:17am PDT
i'm kinda working on this project :DD
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:17am PDT
 
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:17am PDT
but i've had this sketching phase recently so this is something else i did today
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:16am PDT
AHHHH now it's my turn to reassure you! idk i don't have natural talent -- i went to a ton of art classes when i was young so i'm sure you would do well if you had years of experience :D (lol just like my inability to sing)
Sunday, June 25, 2017 at 12:14am PDT
haha tyyyy :) you're so reassuring <3
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 5:07pm PDT
Skip*
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 5:06pm PDT
But I don't even know if I can skip it... got to wait for my ap score
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 5:06pm PDT
Also made me doubt my choice to slip math 1a lol
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 5:06pm PDT
Told me I should probably choose to take engineering 7 in the spring and take either physics 7a or another enginering breadth instead
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 5:05pm PDT
Advisor just got back to me!
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 5:05pm PDT
ALSOOO
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 5:05pm PDT
Yes!!! I would love to visit =)) altho nooo I think you're more prepared for life and college than you think
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 5:04pm PDT
*sends hug back to you*
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 5:04pm PDT
You havw lots of creativity =) don't underestimate yourself
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 5:04pm PDT
LOLOL wait you think I have good handwriting?? Haha well thanks I guess
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 5:03pm PDT
Haha um it's not that I don't like drawing it's just that I'm not very good at it?
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 5:02pm PDT
=(( don't worry about AP scores!!! You're going to get Amazing scores =) i know it
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:49pm PDT
#walloftext
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:49pm PDT
but if you're ever interested in visiting over the summer you know my address :D or we can meet somewhere else. loll if we do i'm probably going to act weird and nerdy and unrelatable (i'll want to talk about books) haha but if you want to find someone less prepared for life and college i'm the person you can cry w/ me
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:46pm PDT
*sends random internet hug*
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:43pm PDT
unless it was relevant to one of my fandoms and that's kind of a niche group of people anyway
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:43pm PDT
i enjoy browsing memes but i have 0 creativity in appealing to meme audiences so no i probably would not make one
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:42pm PDT
LOL NO
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:42pm PDT
lol ty for the compliment although that's probably not true :) do you just not like drawing v much? i am still in love w/ your slant-y handwriting btw and there's generally a correlation between good handwriting and art skills
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:41pm PDT
idk i'm always super anxious (but you already know that bc you've been privy to my various worrying session ahaha)
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:41pm PDT
also worrying about ap scores :'(
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:40pm PDT
:) being lazy and chilling is basically what i'm doing every second of the day too
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:34pm PDT
LOL are you going to start posting your own memes?
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:34pm PDT
Gj*
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:34pm PDT
=)) go
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:34pm PDT
Lol that's wayyyyy better than I could ever draw haha
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:33pm PDT
OMG LILYYYY I DIDN'T KNOW YOU COULD DRAW!!!!
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:33pm PDT
Life is alright haha =P being lazy and just chilling =)) hbu?
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:33pm PDT
Yup I'll contact them after today, just to give them the benefit of doubt
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:32pm PDT
HI LILY!!!
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:27pm PDT
also tfw you're spending wayyyyy too much time on the ucbmfet page :P
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:26pm PDT
the hips are too wide and there are a lot of other issues but i think this is p good for someone who hasn't drawn in 4 years hahaha
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:25pm PDT
 
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:25pm PDT
also how is life for you rn? i keep not being productive and watching a lot of anime haha
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:24pm PDT
tell me when they do get back to you though :D
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT
wait seriously? i wonder if your advisor is inundated w/ other submitted schedules or simply lazy... :/ did you contact them? i think their email / phone # is somewhere in the golden bear advising module
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 4:22pm PDT
JESSICA HI :)))
Friday, June 23, 2017 at 12:52am PDT
tfw your academic advisor hasnt gotten back to you yet and its already june 23
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 11:18pm PDT
Oh interesting lol I'll check it out later =) thanks for the recommendation haha
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 11:18pm PDT
Haha I suppose so ==
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 11:17pm PDT
And nooo I wouldn't say you're an "average" student. Definitely not
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 11:17pm PDT
Wow =(( that's a lot I wish you the best of luck
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:54pm PDT
lolll .io stands for input/output and at times indian ocean. it's actually a preferred extension for programmers
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:53pm PDT
also, whenever you're stressed i recommend sketch.io to literally scratch away your thoughts w/ paint
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:53pm PDT
haha you don't need to congratulate me i didn't do anything but yours should be coming soon! :))
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:52pm PDT
i'll probably take out col writ r4b eventually
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:52pm PDT
my academic advisor either has super high expectations or doesn't know what they're doing bc they think 3 technicals and a r & c b is a logical 1st seem load (maybe for some ppl but def not the average berkeley student aka me)
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:51pm PDT
yes that actually sounds like summer! :) sleep during the day and wake up in the afternoon and basically have nothing to worry about. that seems like a lot of fun :DD
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:49pm PDT
Congrats !
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:49pm PDT
Has yours been approved?
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:49pm PDT
No haha my academic advisor hasn't replied to me yet
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:48pm PDT
Haha I'm more of a night owl altho recently my sleeping schedule has been so thrown off I sleep and wake up whenever
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:48pm PDT
Aww lol
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:45pm PDT
i just realized i write in all caps a lot
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:45pm PDT

Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:45pm PDT

Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:45pm PDT

Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:44pm PDT

Haha thanks for the support =)) Imma try to make more covers over the summer
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:42pm PDT
I haven't heard the song yet but thanks for the recommendation =)
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:42pm PDT
haha you don't understand that reference i think :D but he's basically this super emotional and self-centered guy
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:42pm PDT
i'm a lot like bokuto from haikyuu
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:42pm PDT
ty for always supporting me haha
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:41pm PDT
lol i think the fact that i am going overboard means i'm not actually ok. i'm like kind of in this fugue state rn :/ but i don't want to bother you w/ my problems
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:41pm PDT
=(( it's okay even though it will get harder I know you can do it!!!
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:39pm PDT

Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:31pm PDT
there isn't innocence in the air exactly but it feels like the calm before the storm if you get what i mean lolll
Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:31pm PDT

Friday, June 16, 2017 at 8:31pm PDT

Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 4:27pm PDT

Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 4:27pm PDT
i kind of also have a couple of questions: 1) do we have to wear our grad outfits to the rehearsal tmrw? 2) do salutatorians have to give speeches? (pls say no. idk whom to ask bc i know nothing about graduation)
Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 4:26pm PDT

Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 4:25pm PDT

Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 4:25pm PDT
also did you get your grad gown? (well of course you did, i saw you, but what color is it? my sis told me red -- which i chose -- is ugly :'( )
Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT
it's almost like we're writing letters to each other haha
Wednesday, June 14, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT
AHHH study abroad sounds so exciting!! :) unfortunately, apparently my major discourages it bc a lot of required classes aren't offered in other countries and then i won't graduate on time lolll
Monday, June 12, 2017 at 9:48pm PDT
i havent seen loony tunes in a REALLY long time but yeah haha i see what you mean
Monday, June 12, 2017 at 9:47pm PDT

Monday, June 12, 2017 at 9:46pm PDT

Monday, June 12, 2017 at 9:45pm PDT

Monday, June 12, 2017 at 9:45pm PDT

Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:58pm PDT

Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:57pm PDT

Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:56pm PDT

Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:55pm PDT

Monday, June 12, 2017 at 3:54pm PDT

Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 1:16am PDT

Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 1:05am PDT

Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 1:04am PDT
roller coaster project really is dumb. there's no point to it and you don't learn anything. i hope you get a good grade on it though! you deserve it after undergoing benn this year
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 1:03am PDT
ha ha ha i am not very good at physics at all as evidenced from this year so obviously physics 1 grade / ap test score shouldn't turn you off from the subject
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 1:02am PDT
i never thought i was a particularly lucky person
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 1:02am PDT
sometimes i think it was pure luck :)
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 1:02am PDT
lolll i was so bad at anything engineering / building related i still don't know how i got accepted to cal
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 1:01am PDT
haha i hope you get a chance to at least check out some of the summer programs offered by cal (unless you already have summer plans -- i really don't personally) bc for me ik it'll be hard acclimating to the new environment of college
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 1:00am PDT
also thanks for approving my request LOL <3 <3
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 12:59am PDT

Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 12:55am PDT
but i love the foothill dorms so :D
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 12:55am PDT
i feel like crossroads is more value for your money but inconvenient in terms of distance
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 12:54am PDT
haha i've heard mixed reviews about foothill's dining halls! i'm probably going to check out crossroads to at some point & i'm definitely going to drag you along too (i got the standard meal plan, wbu?)
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 12:53am PDT
i'm sure you'll do better than me though. i was such a slacker last year (and i'm slacking more this year, especially in physics)
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 12:53am PDT
:'(
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 12:53am PDT

Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 12:51am PDT
the possibilities are endless!
Saturday, June 3, 2017 at 12:51am PDT

oh yeah, what's your senior project about?
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 10:17pm PDT

Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 10:17pm PDT
ALSO are you applying to PREP?
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 10:17pm PDT
sorryyy i've been bugging you so much about this i totally understand if you're no longer interested
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 10:16pm PDT
it'll probably be really hard & dry & boring -- full disclaimer bc i tried reading the book last year & i only got halfway thru before i thought calculus was a hellish demon sent to ruin my summer
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 10:16pm PDT
but anyway if you're interested, i'll share the schedule & the textbook (i have online copies) w/ you
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 10:15pm PDT
which makes me feel like i should give up but i have too much pride to do that haha
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 10:15pm PDT
but... according to calculations, if i start on june 11, i'll finish my textbooks by aug 13 :/
Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 10:15pm PDT

Wednesday, May 31, 2017 at 10:14pm PDT

Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:13pm PDT
and bother you
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:13pm PDT
i will burst into your dorm room at 6:00 AM in the morning on weekends
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:12pm PDT
i'm in WiSE :/ ahhh now i don't know anybody there and we'll be living in different buildings this makes me sad
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:04pm PDT
i was thinking about getting renters insurance bc it insures up to $5000 & what if my laptop gets stolen & stuff but i'm not sure yet... this is v confusing imo bc ik cal is making a profit & i'm not sure if i support this blatant sponsorship
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:03pm PDT
i'll be doing this for all of my future classes (gotta keep that gap > 3.0 at cal lol or else my sis will make fun of me)
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:02pm PDT
but i'll be going over math 1a, 1b, and rigorous proof material from a college calc textbook over the summer so if you're interested in studying / getting a leg up w/ me, we can definitely do the problem sets, watch the lectures, take the practice midterms / finals together :)) luckily, they're freely available online
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 10:00pm PDT
:'( i heard the math 1 series is really hard & basically weeder classes so i'm trying to get out of it (unless my adviser objects)
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:59pm PDT
lmk when you finalize your scheduleeee :))
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:59pm PDT
honestly, i'm still not sure if i'll be taking 3 or 4 four-unit classes in the fall (the latter seems a bit much)
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:59pm PDT
:) :) lolll i was on track to procrastinating too but my mom forced me to finish everything yesterday bc she was so excited
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 9:57pm PDT
haha i meant the socratic seminar in martin's class ik i'm very eloquent (i just realized that made no sense when i was rereading it) yay that sounds v serendipitous btw. i really hate socratic seminars & wish river gave us credit on some assignment or the other on ditch day but he didn't :/
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 8:46pm PDT
Yayyy hopefully we'll be able to. I'll let you know my tentative schedule haha when I do module 3
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 8:45pm PDT
No I'M not in WISE=P are you? =)
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 8:45pm PDT
Ummm lol haven't really thought about it. As of right now I'm probably not going to get renters insurance
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 8:44pm PDT
I have to take math 1b, maybe even 1a if I did bad on my AP calc ab test. Not sure if it's exactly a requirement for my major (i think it is) but I can't skip out of it anyways lol
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 8:43pm PDT
I haven't gotten up to module 3 yet haha sorry =( been procrastinating on it
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 8:43pm PDT
Awww <3 I think YOU'RE a ray of sunshine too =))
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 8:42pm PDT
"Martin seminar"? LOL not completely sure what that means but she was really nice about us showing up even tho it was ditch day and gave us all full credit =))
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 8:42pm PDT
Yeah me too =P need study buddies
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 4:11pm PDT
i want you to be in at least one of my classes so we can go to lecture/lab/discussion together :) :)
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 4:10pm PDT
omg also almost forgot about this, are you in WiSE? :DD
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 4:10pm PDT
OH YEAH also on the housing app, are you going to get renter's insurance? (idk my parents wanted me to ask around about that)
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 4:10pm PDT
pls don't take math 1b :/ :/ (wait is it a requirement for you?)
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 4:09pm PDT
what classes are you planning on taking (i want to see if there are any overlaps :D )?
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 4:09pm PDT
also, golden bear advising is out!
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 4:09pm PDT

Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 4:08pm PDT
YES THANK YOU SO MUCH i probably wouldn't have gone looking for the fb group otherwise
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 4:08pm PDT
oh wait was the seminar like the martin seminar? i heard you would get extra credit for that (lol i'm so late w/ asking this question)
Thursday, May 25, 2017 at 4:07pm PDT
:))) yes i would definitely love to study together sometime honestly i would die w/o study buddies @ cal
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 10:21pm PDT
just wanted to make sure
Monday, May 22, 2017 at 10:21pm PDT

Monday, May 8, 2017 at 8:48pm PDT
Woah! Lithium battercharger is super smart using all this electricity and magnetism vocabulary =))
Monday, May 8, 2017 at 8:47pm PDT
Yes I am taking ap calc tomorrow =((( just want to do well enough to get out of math 1a haha
Monday, May 8, 2017 at 8:47pm PDT
I like the meaning behind the gif. It's very nice =) also sad haha
Monday, May 8, 2017 at 8:46pm PDT

actually idk if that's actually possible but it sounds smart so i'll go w/ it
Monday, May 8, 2017 at 6:05pm PDT
ugh my brain has melted from electric current passing through a toroid loop counterclockwise because of a uniform magnetic field
Monday, May 8, 2017 at 6:04pm PDT
good luck on ap calculus tmrw (you are taking the test right? :) )!!
Monday, May 8, 2017 at 6:00pm PDT
i'm getting overly poetic now
Monday, May 8, 2017 at 6:00pm PDT
but i picked it mainly bc it hearkens back to simpler days when the only thing i'd care about was the next avatar the last airbender episode
Monday, May 8, 2017 at 5:59pm PDT
hope it doesn't hurt your eyes haha
Monday, May 8, 2017 at 5:59pm PDT
^ the above is me rn after physics c electricity & magnetism

Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:58pm PDT
uhhh
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:58pm PDT
ha
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:58pm PDT
i have to take physics 1a regardless to :P maybe u could teach me
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:58pm PDT
well im sure you'll do great on mechanics :___
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:57pm PDT
omg youre lily!! ofc you did really well in physics :)
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:57pm PDT
 
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:57pm PDT
random, but on a scale of 1-10, how creepy is this
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:57pm PDT
also
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:57pm PDT
and i think i'll have to take either physics 1a or 1b depending on how i do on mechanics :) maybe we'll be in the same class
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:56pm PDT
i was planning out my courses
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:56pm PDT
yay we can die in our few physics classes together
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:56pm PDT
i'm sure you'll be fine :))) i thought i failed the physics exam & i was worrying about it all summer (my parents can testify to this) but i ended up doing well, so... & in my experience, it's the ppl who say that everything was easy who underestimate the test :)
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:55pm PDT
but we dont have to go to like a super high level of it
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:55pm PDT
yeah theres a few physics classes
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:55pm PDT
LOL no wayy it will not be easy for me
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:54pm PDT
haha yeah i mean i guess. but comparatively :P
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:54pm PDT
frq was better
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:54pm PDT
nice :) physics 1 test was meh. multiple choice was me guessing a lot
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:54pm PDT
you'll do great tomorrow! i know it!
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:53pm PDT
don't you have to do a lot of physics?
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:53pm PDT
lol maybe for you though
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:53pm PDT
i don't think any engineering major is easy :)
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:53pm PDT
i just read above
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:53pm PDT
omg wait you're doing ieor
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:53pm PDT
HOW WAS PHYSICS 1? :)))
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:52pm PDT
i forgot to ask you
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:52pm PDT
waiiiit
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:52pm PDT
wiley plus is basically ten marks from hell
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:52pm PDT
also i'm really happy bc i realized my physics teacher postponed our wiley plus assignment
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:51pm PDT
no haha you can keep doing so bc i don't really want to study :/ i'm halfway thru a prep book & feeling pretty complacent
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:51pm PDT
im eating and chilling right now haha
Wednesday, May 3, 2017 at 4:51pm PDT
oh haha i guess i should stop messaging u then :P

Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:58pm PDT
(but not why I chose it lol )
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:58pm PDT
haha no im doing IEOR (heard its one of the easier engineering majors)
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:57pm PDT
yikes have fun with eecs! since i'll be on the engineering side i might come visit u at soda hall? haha
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:56pm PDT
haha dont worry there's a lot of people from American going to cal so for sure you'll know more than just one person
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:56pm PDT
aww <3 that's really sweet :P
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:55pm PDT

Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:55pm PDT
:) i'm doing random roommate
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:55pm PDT
i hope that's true! idk i think i just heard the bad rumors about berkeley, there's a huge variety of students there
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:54pm PDT
wait what was your major again? mech e? b/c if it's anything stem that's super hard (but you're so smart you'll be fine) :))
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:54pm PDT
haha we should hang out at cal :) i'll probably be dying in eecs though most of the time, the others in the major said we'll even be sleeping at soda hall sometimes bc of projects
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:53pm PDT
so happy
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:52pm PDT
YES i actually know someone at cal now
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:52pm PDT

Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:51pm PDT
i mean i saw you from the corner of my eye, but i was questioning myself
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:51pm PDT
omg seeing you on cal day was such a surprise
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:47pm PDT
how are YOU ?
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:47pm PDT
so :P i was able to avoid that
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:47pm PDT
i do have a roommate tho, just not from people's posts
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:47pm PDT
oh :( idk I heard that generally people are super cooperative and try to help each other learn / succeed. but idk
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:46pm PDT
AND WE SHOULD DEFINITELY GO HANG OUT BECAUSE I ENJOY SPENDING TIME WITH YOU
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:46pm PDT
SO I WILL SEE YOU THERE
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:45pm PDT
YES I AM GOING TO CAL!! OFFICIALLY COMMITTED AND EVERYTHING
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:45pm PDT
im doing okay haha. also procrastinaating
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:45pm PDT
are you doing random roommate? or already found one?
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:45pm PDT
oh :( good luck with stats and physics!! i know that you totally got this :)
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:44pm PDT
IT WAS NICE SEEING YOU ON CAL DAY LOL
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:44pm PDT
LILYYY HII
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:44pm PDT
i don't blame you. i heard that ppl are really nice the first couple of days and then get super competitive & cutthroat? idk, it's not like i have a choice b/c of financial reasons
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:43pm PDT
lol i just read above that you're skeptical of ppl
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:43pm PDT
also are you going to cal??!
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:42pm PDT
how are you doing?
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:42pm PDT
why do i do this to myself
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:42pm PDT
and now i'm procrastinating by reading roommate intros (even though i'm not choosing one) lol
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:42pm PDT
i'm going to fail
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:42pm PDT
sorry just dying from stats & physics rn
Wednesday, April 26, 2017 at 10:42pm PDT
it's been a while :)

LIllyyyyy
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:48pm PDT
sorry if that makes me a bad person
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:48pm PDT
but idk im just a bit skeptical of people
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:48pm PDT
yeah lol ofc everyone SEEMS nice
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:47pm PDT
yes, i am going to the overnight program + cal day. i think it will really be the last deciding factor (as it is my last college visit) of where i will decide to go
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:47pm PDT
lol i would be honored to delivery your eulogy, but i dont think im going to need to any time soon
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:46pm PDT
oh haha. youre right i should probably start studying for ap tests woops
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:46pm PDT
yeah it is a great college! and definitely a lot of people going for many reasons (and lol my parents want me to go too, so its not just you)
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:45pm PDT
berkeley, usc, ucsd
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:45pm PDT
thanks haha :P lol sounds like a delightful summer
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:45pm PDT
it would be a great experience if i had the time, i think. everyone on the berkeley page seems nice
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:44pm PDT
are you going??
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:44pm PDT
i'm going to be studying for physics & stats b/c those ap tests will murder me :'( expect to deliver my eulogy
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:44pm PDT
but that's b/c it's during spring break
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:44pm PDT
haha no
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:44pm PDT
i admire that you're taking your time
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:44pm PDT
i like that you aren't immediately just going to berkeley for prestige. i feel like i violated my innermost principles by going along w/ my parents' wishes & w/ financial concerns etc. but it's a great college. i'll be fine (i think)
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:43pm PDT
which three?!!!!
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:42pm PDT
but it sounds as though it served a good purpose this time :)
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:42pm PDT
ew idk why i just hate rain
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:42pm PDT
:)) i hope you had fun! (lol 'interesting' doesn't sound v promising) i've always thought college campuses were beautiful but the smell during summer @ davis was a pretty nasty wakeup call
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:42pm PDT
are you going to the swe overnight program
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:40pm PDT
haha i think i have a top 3 rn
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:40pm PDT
also it rained quite a bit
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:40pm PDT
but later it wasnt
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:40pm PDT
yes, it smelled very much like cows
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:40pm PDT
prob because of the way the wind was blowing
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:40pm PDT
and at first
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:40pm PDT
yep, went to the davis one
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:39pm PDT
yeah :P
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:39pm PDT
i'm curious :))
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:39pm PDT
+ which college are you leaning towards rn?
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:38pm PDT
i heard that all the uc decision days were overlapping! so did you go to one? also, did uc davis smell like cows?
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:38pm PDT
was interesting
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:37pm PDT
i went to decision uc davis
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:37pm PDT
alright
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:37pm PDT
how is your weekend?
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:37pm PDT

Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:35pm PDT

I feel so guilty.
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:33pm PDT

Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:32pm PDT
i don't know what to say b/c i'm smiling (you can't see that but i'll just be blunt about it)

Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:30pm PDT
also, in response to the above: are you serious b/c i'm only ok at chem b/c it kinda runs in the family! my grandpa was a chem professor & my dad was 1st in his state for chem so i have a lot of resources
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:28pm PDT
SORRY
Saturday, April 8, 2017 at 9:28pm PDT

Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:11pm PDT
i also got into Berkeley, and because of that my dad wants me to go really badly
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:10pm PDT
im conflicted about colleges
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:10pm PDT
on the college front
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:10pm PDT
im doing meh in life
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:10pm PDT
thats really inspsiring!!
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:10pm PDT

Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:09pm PDT
WOOOT WOOOOOTT
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:09pm PDT
OMG CONGRATS ON GETTING ACCEPTED TO BERKELEY / DECIDING TO GO
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:09pm PDT
:)
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:09pm PDT
wow!! congrats to your sister. haha dont worry, im sure you and her are both great geniuses in your own ways
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:08pm PDT
pshh youre too good for the schools that rejected you! lithium batterycharger is better than all of them :)
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:07pm PDT
haha its okay i always procrastinate on everything so its relatable
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:07pm PDT
i didnt go to cal shakes
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:07pm PDT
omg space documentary?? in 4th grade?? youre amazing haha
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:05pm PDT
lol didnt you get an A in chem? which is arguably better than an a-? so like you're a super genius!! and thus the top lol, not me
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 11:05pm PDT
UMM BUT i DONT THINK IM AT THE TOP LOL
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:48pm PDT
btw, how are you doing (on the college front & life in general)?
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:48pm PDT
/rant
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:48pm PDT
omg what a wall of text
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:48pm PDT
i think i'm trying to prove something to myself, that i can challenge myself to be better & transcend my limits. i'm sure any college can give me that, but i think berkeley will make me grow up faster bc of the self sufficiency needed to succeed there
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:47pm PDT
anyway, i've decided i'm going to go to berkeley :) after this long convo i had w/ my dad @ starbucks
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:46pm PDT
lol my sis got 4th place for anatomy @ science olympiad states & now i think she's a genius bc she's made friends w/ a bunch of smart ppl -- she's so much more social than me (lol it would be amazing/jealousy-making if she got into the schools i got rejected from...)
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:45pm PDT
sorry i'm spamming you at this point (i'm definitely expecting a reply that takes like a week or so bc that's what i tend to do -- i put off the things that i want to think about & finalize before i write back)
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:44pm PDT
did you go to cal shakes?
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:44pm PDT
OMG WOW your field trip sounds so cool
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:44pm PDT
my dream school used to be MIT but that was bc of this random space documentary i watched in 4th grade which made me think institute of technology sounded cool lol & also the hacks
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:43pm PDT
and that was for the best imo too :D
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:43pm PDT
haha i did end up getting into both schools but i also did get rejected from stanford & mit
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:43pm PDT
i admire that :)
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:43pm PDT
but you are also a very hard worker
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:42pm PDT
lol that's the only grade i know from you
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:42pm PDT
you got an a- in chem :))) you're a genius
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:42pm PDT
ARE YOU KIDDING ME I THINK YOU'RE AT THE TOP
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:42pm PDT
this is bad haha
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:41pm PDT
i feel like spamming you more rn
Sunday, April 2, 2017 at 9:41pm PDT

Wednesday, March 29, 2017 at 7:26pm PDT
I don't really have a dream school? I mean at first I guess I wanted to go to Stanford, and then I kind of wanted to go to UCLA

Thursday, March 23, 2017 at 11:53pm PDT
this seems really interesting (& i'm not saying this just because) because i think i've actually listened to it before i fell asleep once
Thursday, March 23, 2017 at 11:52pm PDT
although i think i've heard of it before
Thursday, March 23, 2017 at 11:52pm PDT
my first reaction was what is asmr
Thursday, March 23, 2017 at 11:52pm PDT
1) i feel like i need to explicitly say that i am not judging you @ all & my opinion of you has not changed bc you can't see me smiling behind this screen or read my mind, but we're all a little weird in our own strange & beautiful ways so i think this makes you a little more human to me :))
Thursday, March 23, 2017 at 11:50pm PDT
i listen / watch asmr
Thursday, March 23, 2017 at 11:50pm PDT
lol

Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:59pm PDT
:/ i wish good tv series like 24 were on netflix. tbh i've been watching "limitless" recently and it's a criminal procedural centered around a smart drug called NZT and i was so interested i read the prequel book "the dark fields" (it's super interesting; you should read it)
Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:58pm PDT
hahaha my parents made me drop all but one and threatened me with the loss of the watch i got on my birthday. it was a squarish digital watch that i've been wanting for ages. yeah, that convinced me pretty quickly haha
Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:56pm PDT
:'( i know ppl who already started school and had shorter summers than us. tbh in india, they only have a 1 month long summer. haha i would die in india
Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:56pm PDT
lol me programming my inbox was actually kind of an immature and weird decision lol. looking back, the only positive thing was that i learned a lot about bootstrap and css haha :)
Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:54pm PDT
i'm very test-lucky
Thursday, August 18, 2016 at 11:54pm PDT

Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 1:05pm PDT

Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 1:04pm PDT

Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 1:02pm PDT
worse news: they emailed me back and want me to help
Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 1:02pm PDT
(idk why i even did that, it seems like my subconscious wants me to actually do something for college apps)
Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 1:01pm PDT
yeahhh about that, good news: last night, i got lifesavers, bad news: i ate them and applied to a bunch of volunteer opportunities
Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 1:01pm PDT

Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 1:00pm PDT

Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 12:59pm PDT

Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 12:58pm PDT

Thursday, August 11, 2016 at 12:58pm PDT

Sunday, July 17, 2016 at 10:13pm PDT
hahaha but both of us lilys are complete opposites, which is kind of interesting, and btw there was never any doubt that your t-shirt would be socially acceptable :) i was in love with it the moment i saw it (like when grell sees sebastian lol)
Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 9:07pm PDT
I haven't had gum in awhile... I rarely have it after I got braces haha

Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 7:54pm PDT
oh she's lily 1 and i'm lily 2 but officially she's lily v and i'm lily b :) it's so confusing when the teacher assigns groups and reads them out loud

Saturday, July 16, 2016 at 7:52pm PDT

Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:58pm PDT

Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:58pm PDT

until nothing is left but a carcass that will attempt to do well in college
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:56pm PDT

Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:56pm PDT
LOL is it bad that at first when i read "common app" i thought of pokemon go?
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:55pm PDT

Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:55pm PDT

Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:51pm PDT
haha nice job, and LOL I liked the octopus in finding dory :) so i guess by transitive property, that means...
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:50pm PDT
"dw you'll be desensitized soon" LOL isnt that something i should be MORE worried about than your "weirdness"
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:50pm PDT

Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:47pm PDT
;)
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:47pm PDT

Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:39pm PDT
YAYAY good job :)
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:39pm PDT
(THAT YOU ARE MORE KNOWLEDGABLE IN THE SUBJECTS THAN THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO TOOK THE AP TESTS HAHA)
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:39pm PDT
awww :(( DONT CRY LILY, HAVE CONFIDENCE IN YOURSELF
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:38pm PDT
AHHH
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:38pm PDT
OMG LILY SO SMART I CANT
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:38pm PDT
OOH GROUP STUFF (i dont want to drag you down though :/ )
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:38pm PDT
i mean, it's not exactly that i dont like it (i feel like i would need to be more knowledgable to gain a preference of whether or not i like it) it's just that i dont feel like doing it... like how i dont want to exercise lmao
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:37pm PDT
i'm happy i don't have to take physics sat II
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:37pm PDT
but anyway, besides test scores
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:37pm PDT
lol
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:37pm PDT
that was kind of depressing
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:37pm PDT
i woke up crying
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:36pm PDT
although i had nightmares days before that i'd get a 2 in physics
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:36pm PDT
you were right :)
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:36pm PDT
yeah
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:36pm PDT

omggg ikr i used to pull so many 5:00 in the mornings last year
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:35pm PDT
doing stuff in a group is usually more fun than going at it alone haha
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:35pm PDT
maybe one day we should code together
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:35pm PDT
:) start out by making a basic calculator
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:35pm PDT
haha if you don't like it, maybe you should look for a different hobby? tbh i like breadboarding more than i like coding but hardware engineering is not a marketable skill nowadays :(
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:33pm PDT
lol resistance avalon is actually a game i played at cosmos :) it's an actual game, not one i own unfortunately
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:33pm PDT
;)
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:33pm PDT
ITS CATCHY RIGHT??
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:33pm PDT
haha Lily staying up to check AP test scores to see 5 5 5 5 5
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:32pm PDT
10?? WOW THATS SO EARLY FOR LILY :o
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:32pm PDT
i also dont know enough yet to code a game (unless it's a really basic one haha)
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:31pm PDT
a friday? hm.. lol i have no motivation for coding tbh :/
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:31pm PDT
how did you name it haha
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:31pm PDT
OOOH GAMEEE
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:30pm PDT

Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:30pm PDT
why is it stuck in my head
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:30pm PDT
you are the music in meeeee
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:30pm PDT
omg
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:30pm PDT
(lol except for checking test scores)
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:30pm PDT
i think i've forgotten how to pull an all-nighter
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:29pm PDT
such a contrast to the school year
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:29pm PDT
hahaha same. i fall asleep at like 10 every night
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:29pm PDT
any game. lol from personal experience, it helps so much with motivation :)
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:29pm PDT
i suggest setting aside a friday to just code a game
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:29pm PDT
haha i'm too lazy to learn java as well so i don't blame you :) but i did code a simulation of resistance avalon... if you ever want to play it, here's the link: https://repl.it/C9r9/228
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:27pm PDT
haha its okay, at least you watched it today and now know the wonders of the hsm

oh yeah
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:24pm PDT
so you can compile online instead of having to download c++ to your computer :)
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:24pm PDT
my brother was like "my professor said it was better to learn the harder ones first because if you master those than the easier ones are really easy to learn" or something idk
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:24pm PDT
https://repl.it/languages/cpp
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:23pm PDT
lol maybe, idk
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:22pm PDT
wait, i have something for you :)
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:22pm PDT
ahaha maybe you should start out with python though? i heard that the syntax is easier. personally, i keep forgetting the ; at the end of line
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:21pm PDT
how is Girls Who Code?? :)
Thursday, July 14, 2016 at 8:21pm PDT

Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:54pm PDT
lol i will reply to your most recent messages after i reply to ur older ones
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:53pm PDT
YOURE NOT STUPIDDD
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:53pm PDT
HONESTLY have no idea what you said about the socing stuff but seems difficult! Have fun
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:53pm PDT
now that i've successfully depressed you (insert sarcasm here [i still don't know where it is sometimes haha]), how are you on this fine sunny day?
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:53pm PDT
aww your dad gave a nice simile though, although LOL im sure you didnt sound that bad
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:53pm PDT
when ap scores are coming out right after 4th of july
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:52pm PDT
:(
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:52pm PDT
lol i'm weird
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:52pm PDT
i thought it was a neighborhood conspiracy
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:52pm PDT
LOL "gave all the squirrels in the neighborhood rabies" that is terrifying, but at the same time hilarious :P
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:52pm PDT
btw some realtor was leaving american flags outside ppl's houses to publicize & i got really weirded out when i saw them
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:52pm PDT
wow now i'm just sending you lots of info in a small cramped dialog box
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:51pm PDT
so irresponsible
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:51pm PDT
for the last few weeks i've been sleeping at like 11:30
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:51pm PDT
me being productive is the biggest joke of all time
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:51pm PDT
hahahahaha
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:50pm PDT
cool! what summer class btw? are you going to brown with michelle? (lol i'm just guessing)
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:50pm PDT
you'll do amazing. you don't need anything but basic math to code
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:49pm PDT
:) i'd say pick a language and stick with it, and also focus on project-based learning. if you're going to do c++ make sure you're programming games
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:49pm PDT
haha it's actually pretty hard. i finished a course on the foundations of object oriented design last night but i still need to implement the actual coding and stuff :/ some ppl understand programming so easily which makes me feel stupid lol
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:48pm PDT
also, my dad heard me singing "get lucky" at night in junior year and he asked why i was making a noise that sounded like an owl getting strangled :(
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:47pm PDT
when they heard my voice
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:47pm PDT
i gave all the squirrels in the neighborhood rabies
Thursday, June 30, 2016 at 6:47pm PDT
lolllllll you should listen to me sing
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:59pm PDT
At least you're being very productive though :))
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:59pm PDT
Omg really! You feel like it's more stressful? Aw 😞
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:59pm PDT
Great job!
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:59pm PDT
Oh wow, getting so many things done already
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:59pm PDT
My summer is going alright! Hopefully I do well in my summer class
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:58pm PDT
No I haven't. Although based on your recommendation I probably should?
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:58pm PDT
I haven't even started actually learning C++ yet so uh... The procrastination is real
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:57pm PDT
Bored? LOLOL typical LILY :P
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:57pm PDT
IM PROUD OF YOU
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:57pm PDT
YAYYY GOOD JOB GETTING INTO GIRLS WHO CODE :))))
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:56pm PDT
Ooh is Java hard? Actually you're so smart anything is not too hard for you haha
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:55pm PDT
Hahaha I'm sure you don't sound "horrible" when you sing :))
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:55pm PDT
Aww yay I'm glad you liked the mashup
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:54pm PDT
Haha it okay, I understand you're very busy
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:44pm PDT
when summer is more stressful than junior year
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:43pm PDT
lol personally i had to make a linkedin account and the counselor recommendation packets are already online and college apps are so close and :'(
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:43pm PDT
how is your summer btw? (should have asked this first)
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:42pm PDT
ugh i hate java classes and objects and ahdsfweio so i relate to you so much
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:42pm PDT
c++ is actually a hard language to learn bc of the rigid syntax. did you ever try python? or even scratch/snap (not actual programming languages but they introduce the concepts)
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:41pm PDT
i ended up getting into girls who code :) but i'm kind of bored there so i can understand why they waitlisted me last year haha
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:41pm PDT
or at least trying to
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:41pm PDT
YAS C++ i'm actually learning java rn
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:40pm PDT
but i just listened to your mashup #2 and i was feeling so jealous bc i've tried singing before but i honestly sound horrible compared to you lollll you're amazing <3
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:40pm PDT
sorryyyyy for not replying in like 283429 months
Wednesday, June 29, 2016 at 7:40pm PDT

Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:28pm PDT
yeah, you probably did lol
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:28pm PDT
ugh i dont want to memorize mine lol
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:28pm PDT
yeah that's true. eye contact is mucho importante
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:28pm PDT
aww dont be sad
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:27pm PDT
LOl what is this APENG
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:25pm PDT
i give myself 30 minutes before i do
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:25pm PDT
lol at least for me, whenever i try to study in bed (i'm doing so rn) i fall asleep
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:25pm PDT
sooo do you have any more hw rn?
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:25pm PDT
haha ty for the motivation :)
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:24pm PDT
thinkception
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:24pm PDT
i don't think i was thinking and i'm probably thinking right now that i'm not thinking that i was thinking when i said i wasn't thinking when i picked my subjects
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:24pm PDT
lol who wants to do work.
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:23pm PDT
haha then by that logic i have had senioritis since the end of freshman year (when you start studying ap physics 3 weeks before the exam)
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:23pm PDT
yeah just well prepared. i'm probably going to try to memorize most of it though bc eye contact important
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:22pm PDT
ahaha i guess but i remember you saying my song was upbeat lol i thought i was going to fail for not setting the right tone after that
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:21pm PDT
the fact that you have problems makes me sad :( (omg i hate this emoticon)
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:21pm PDT
lol i can analyze that the fact that you separated the 'ha's indicates hesitance that lends a general sense of sarcasm and mocking to that statement (haha jk i'm going to miss apeng. not)
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:20pm PDT
jk I KNOW YOU CAN DO THIS!
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:20pm PDT
LILY WHAT WERE YOU THINKING
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:20pm PDT
/ dont want to do work
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:19pm PDT
senioritis is just a term for when you start getting lazy lol
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:19pm PDT
NOO i havent actually
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:19pm PDT
memorize? we dont have to memorize right... just um. be well prepared? aiya
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:18pm PDT

Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:18pm PDT
ofc not! I have lots of problems of my own
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:18pm PDT
LOL true, you do do that all the time tho lol

Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:15pm PDT
anyway i'm going to go memorize my thing rn (ik i've been so lazy, procrastinating on fb)
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:14pm PDT
hey neither have i :) i've always gotten close but not quite so maybe this will be our first time
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:13pm PDT
oh that's a reassurance. i'm not alone in all of my problems haha
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:12pm PDT
haha sure i'll just steal your paper in chem like i always do with your other stuff like the vocab book
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:12pm PDT
aha yes i'm totally a battery. i'm always in charge of my grades and i can overpower my anxiety (lol lame physics puns - i don't do puns well at all)
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:01pm PDT
:P
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 11:01pm PDT
haha yea.. interesting..

Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 10:50pm PDT
i just think mine is too choppy between the different povs
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 10:50pm PDT
are you serious. i'm sure yours is amazing-er than mine but ty for the compliment anyway
Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 10:49pm PDT

Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 10:00pm PDT

Thursday, June 2, 2016 at 10:00pm PDT

Monday, May 16, 2016 at 9:24pm PDT
we try to do one for this
Monday, May 16, 2016 at 9:24pm PDT
what if instead of trying to do a manipulative of the actual thing
Monday, May 16, 2016 at 9:14pm PDT
hm redox reactions
Monday, May 16, 2016 at 9:13pm PDT
hiii Lily sorry for seeing this so late
Monday, May 16, 2016 at 5:05pm PDT
ugh i can't think of any 'manipulatives'
Monday, May 16, 2016 at 5:05pm PDT
what would you like to do? although meissner effect is completely fine
Monday, May 16, 2016 at 5:05pm PDT
haha this is a bad idea
Monday, May 16, 2016 at 5:05pm PDT
like lithium ion lol
Monday, May 16, 2016 at 5:05pm PDT
we could pick a specific type of battery
Monday, May 16, 2016 at 5:04pm PDT
so, idk if this will work as an alternative to the meissner effect, but what do you think about redox reactions in batteries
Monday, May 16, 2016 at 5:04pm PDT

haha i hope :) but 97 is rlly hard to get. I'd be happy with a 90
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:25am PDT
noo stopp i dont think i'll ever love math again
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:25am PDT
i know you'll score super high like 800
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:25am PDT

Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:22am PDT
omg i'm getting so deep now
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:22am PDT
i'm sure you didn't mess up. we are our own worst critics
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:22am PDT
when you were practicing the presentation with me (sorry i was a horrible acting partner haha) you did amazing so i'm sure you'll get > 97% :))
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:21am PDT
you'll like it :) just like you'll love calc next year lol
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:21am PDT
tttc has such a whimsical tone
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:21am PDT
loll minorly is always better than majorly :) i actually did the definition of majorly last week when i started studying for the apush ap exam at 4:00 the morning of the test... and surprisingly it wasn't that bad so here's to hoping i get >770 on the sat II lol (my parents have high standards :( )
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:19am PDT
im sure you did great!
Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:19am PDT

Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:16am PDT

Sunday, May 8, 2016 at 1:15am PDT

Thursday, April 7, 2016 at 12:19am PDT
NOOO no way im smarter than you in math, its just that you didnt learn it. if you did you would be v good at it i bet =)
Thursday, April 7, 2016 at 12:19am PDT
LOL im pretty sure I was the one who asked you about asymptotes? unless someone else also asked you about them? AND OMG WHATTT HOWELL SKIPPED CHAPTERS LAST YEAR??
Thursday, April 7, 2016 at 12:18am PDT
you'll do great!
Thursday, April 7, 2016 at 12:18am PDT

it's ok :) you'll do amazing & then next year i'll need help for stats from you
Thursday, April 7, 2016 at 12:12am PDT
hmm has to have 1st/2nd group cation & anion that doesn't react w/ water i think so sth along the lines of ba(no3)2
Thursday, April 7, 2016 at 12:12am PDT
you're smarter than me at math :) bc i would fail a test w/ this on it
Thursday, April 7, 2016 at 12:11am PDT
oh ew yeah someone asked me how to find the asymptotes & i didn't know bc howell skipped the chapters last year
Thursday, April 7, 2016 at 12:11am PDT
= why i have to study over summer
Thursday, April 7, 2016 at 12:11am PDT
no, actually, that was my original plan but i'm taking in october bc learning 2 different physics is too hard for me in 1 year :(
Thursday, April 7, 2016 at 12:10am PDT

Friday, March 18, 2016 at 8:00pm PDT
oh yeah, how is stats? lol when you showed me the t-table today did you notice my expression (in chem)? i thought a t-table was somehow related to an ice table and i was panicking bc i'd never heard of it but your mannerisms imply that this is stats-related?
Friday, March 18, 2016 at 7:58pm PDT
but how are you? how's the weekend going? are you actually going to get some sleep like gialdini said to (unlike me)?
Friday, March 18, 2016 at 7:57pm PDT

Friday, March 18, 2016 at 1:36am PDT
lol idk if my standards are low, but i don't think they're gialdini level standards. but i still think you will do amazing tmrw :) i shall be smiling creepily from the audience. so actually today, i was kind of frowning (deep in thought) during one of the presentations and one of the ppl was frowning back at me
Friday, March 18, 2016 at 1:35am PDT
lab must be very exciting
Friday, March 18, 2016 at 1:34am PDT
oh fun
Friday, March 18, 2016 at 1:34am PDT
omg that would be incredible! and very responsible, and a little impossible
Friday, March 18, 2016 at 1:34am PDT
tbh i dont think ive ever seen YOU nervous on stage either
Friday, March 18, 2016 at 1:34am PDT
aw thanks for the compliment. your standards are low? haha
Friday, March 18, 2016 at 1:33am PDT
i dislike this lab for some reason. it's probably too simple
Friday, March 18, 2016 at 1:33am PDT
ugh i'm actually doing the lab rn

yayay :) ty ik i'm becoming more responsible by the second
Friday, March 18, 2016 at 1:32am PDT
also, your presentations are always amazing.. at least by my standards :) i've never seen you get nervous on stage
Friday, March 18, 2016 at 1:31am PDT
it was just a joke. considering that your group didn't even go today. i was kind of playing off of the general theme that i'm not very observant lol... except this time i actually remembered the facts
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 7:47pm PDT
:/
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 7:47pm PDT
now I'm wondering if you were being sarcastic or do you always automatically say that my presentation was amazing, regardless of how it actually went
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 7:47pm PDT
also hahaha THANK YOU. I am flattered, considering that I didn't even go
Thursday, March 17, 2016 at 7:46pm PDT

Friday, February 26, 2016 at 11:27pm PST
(also the crazy thing is that rn my APENG grade is higher than my precalc grade - but only marginally)

Friday, February 26, 2016 at 10:39pm PST
in the beginning of the year in calc, i was having trouble memorizing integration formulas and everyone was ahead of me, but one day i just sat down with the book and read until 5 and when i was done my brain felt liquid-y but it was all clearer.
Friday, February 26, 2016 at 10:37pm PST
idk what usually comforts me is that if i don't do stellar in a subject is that i'll stay up all night one friday (never actually completely happens but still) and read the book and do tons of problems and be way better the next day
Friday, February 26, 2016 at 10:36pm PST
dw about reibenschuh :) and i'm sure you'll do amazing in precal. take this as a challenge to get an A+++++ lol & be brilliant (lol channeling my inner mrs. smith)
Friday, February 26, 2016 at 10:31pm PST

Friday, February 26, 2016 at 6:51pm PST
also Reibensciuch (idk how to type his name) when he was signing my form he was like "what math class are you taking" and i said "precalc H" (although now i realize i couldve said stats too) and he was like "are you getting a B or better" and i said "yeah" (even though my last semester i got a B... living dangerously close to the cut off) and he was like "ok, we'll check in with you at the end of the year, good luck" and now im kind of worried i wont get it bc of my math grade haha ://

Thursday, February 25, 2016 at 11:07pm PST

Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 11:24pm PST
sorry its kind of confusing
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 11:24pm PST
because if u turn it in tomorrow then technically ur deadline should be 11:59
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 11:24pm PST
i advise against it
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 11:24pm PST
however, if you are planning on turning it in afer 11:59 tonight and turning in the paper copt tmrr
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 11:24pm PST
on turnitin.com, the deadline i beleive is for sunday 11:59
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 11:23pm PST
or on saturday after 11:59? idk the 1st line on school loop is confusing me :(
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 11:22pm PST
so question: for the al gore thingy, are we allowed to turn it in tonight but after 11:59?
Thursday, February 18, 2016 at 11:22pm PST

Tuesday, February 9, 2016 at 9:39pm PST
lol in that song, the singer sounded like he was swearing every 2 seconds
Tuesday, February 9, 2016 at 9:39pm PST

also, a caveat: i'm taking ap phys 1, not c, so i won't know calc applications
Tuesday, February 2, 2016 at 4:02pm PST
soooo if you want to compete, do you really want me on your team? bc i'm deciding whether it's worth it to start studying physics earlier in preparation so i don't embarrass anybody in the competition (if, of course, i'm on your team)
Tuesday, February 2, 2016 at 4:01pm PST
sorry i was kinda laughing when you told me (i forgot it existed, i was laughing at myself) so i might have come off as rude (well, no more rude than i usually am :P )
Tuesday, February 2, 2016 at 4:00pm PST
anywayyyy are you really interested in the stem tournament
Tuesday, February 2, 2016 at 3:59pm PST

Tuesday, February 2, 2016 at 3:59pm PST

Friday, January 29, 2016 at 4:23pm PST
and i feel like i should be using rhetorical strategies & arguments to convince you to find the truth of the situation which is that T. S. Eliot is amazing :)
Friday, January 29, 2016 at 4:22pm PST
it's only 3 pages long but it was the most amazing poem i personally have ever read
Friday, January 29, 2016 at 4:22pm PST
oh btw you should really read the poem "The Hollow Men" by T. S. Eliot
Friday, January 29, 2016 at 4:21pm PST

Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 6:28pm PST
lol about the chem lab, i get it now. it's still weird that it's not on school loop though
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 5:44pm PST
but lol my physics teacher didn't even use our final in our sem grade what
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 5:43pm PST
but anyway, we're getting our sem grades tmrw! yay (not)
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 5:43pm PST
i'm confused bc it's not on school loop and normally she clarifies stuff like what graphs we need, sooo
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 5:42pm PST
question: liu lab due tmrw right?
Thursday, January 28, 2016 at 5:42pm PST

Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:30pm PST
but calc has a very broad audience
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:30pm PST
she said she thought she'd hate calc
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:30pm PST
lol you will
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:30pm PST
and you'd get A's. i feel like having more aps motivates you more

Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:28pm PST

Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:26pm PST

promise
Wednesday, January 27, 2016 at 10:26pm PST

Sunday, January 24, 2016 at 10:28pm PST
i've realized that my ending kind of represented a change that was prejudiced in some respects, so i'm scrapping it and writing a new one
Sunday, January 24, 2016 at 10:27pm PST
i haven't sent it yet bc i'm still editing as part of the "now what" months and i'm rewriting some sections
Sunday, January 24, 2016 at 10:25pm PST

Friday, January 22, 2016 at 9:49pm PST
idk what good that'll do. it's a far cry from the 40 pts in freshman year.
Friday, January 22, 2016 at 9:48pm PST

Friday, January 22, 2016 at 9:48pm PST

so now i'm worried even though it's multiple choice
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:51pm PST
but then i checked school loop and gialdini actually wrote up some tips on what to study about
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:51pm PST
hmm i thought the test would be easy
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:49pm PST

LOL unlikely
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:44pm PST
maybe liu will curve something so our grades will go up?
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:44pm PST
your grade shall rise significantly :)
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:43pm PST
she didn't update but i failed it :(
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:43pm PST
omg don't remind me
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:43pm PST
lol yeah grades always have that downward slope after the first couple of weeks
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:42pm PST
also.. maybe i used to like triangles, but after trig not so much
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:42pm PST
tbh I'm still hoping for a miracle
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:42pm PST
hey is there anything the Liu didn't update besides the formal lab?
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:42pm PST
haha reset.. only to plummet back down
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:41pm PST
do you like triangles?
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:40pm PST
finals are the worst thing ever but at least grades are resetting soon right
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:40pm PST
oh well :)
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:40pm PST
it just comes out sounding patronizing
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:40pm PST

Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:38pm PST
here's another pusheen:
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:38pm PST
I feel like I just gave a huge condescending lecture... don't read the above haha
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:38pm PST
I want to wallow in self-pity with you though so lol :)
Thursday, January 21, 2016 at 9:37pm PST
I know how you feel because I know how it's like to have a borderline grade, to be right on the edge of an A and have all of those hours of studying just not be enough. But I feel like something this year has kind of changed because I (and probably others as well) used to be neurotic about getting amazing grades and straight A's but we've realized the true value of such a grade this year. Even a B is wonderful (on Gialdini's class wall, it says that a B is superior work while an A is exceptional, above and beyond). This year, an A is so much more than just something we can show colleges, and anything less than that isn't something to be ashamed of.

Sorry, I have exactly 8, so I don't know.
Wednesday, January 6, 2016 at 8:04pm PST
I guess if you found more than 8 tropes (not intentionally place/not adding to the purpose), you only need to do the most relevant 8. I don't think she'll deduct points for having less than 8, but maybe you should explain them just in case?
Wednesday, January 6, 2016 at 8:02pm PST
IF YOU HAVE MORE THAN 8 SCHEMES/TROPES DO YOU STILL ONLY IDENTIFY 8 OR DO YOU IDENTIFY ALL OF THEM??
Wednesday, January 6, 2016 at 8:01pm PST

Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:10pm PST
hahahahah i'm not amazing. it was for a physics assignment
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:10pm PST
there's a reason i like airports (energy to entropy)
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:10pm PST
omg that sounds so depressing at first glance, but both good and bad things without discrimination
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:09pm PST
i wish i had some platitude (wow sat vocab lily win) to make you feel better (idk what even made your day bad). oh wait, i just got one: "All things end"
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:08pm PST
lol if you ate anything that often, anyone would get bored (like me)
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:08pm PST
lol i'm going to fail that speech. how am i going to fulfill my dream of being a stand up comedian?
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:07pm PST
OMG i'm crying about the test too. although my grade didn't drop that much (it's not too high lol) so i'm feeling better. my parents didn't even notice it (i'm not telling them haha)
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:06pm PST
lol i'm such a hypocrite about 100%s. no matter what you get, you're getting spammed by pusheen. it is unavoidable
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:06pm PST

Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:06pm PST
and i still have an ok grade and so do you :))
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 10:05pm PST
omgg lol you're not good at math? tbh that statement is backed by incorrect logic bc i was never good at math either. also, i heard that howell really is 10x harder this year, so it def isn't your fault. she doesn't teach, apparently
Tuesday, December 8, 2015 at 9:41pm PST

Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:31pm PST
of loc i think
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:31pm PST
and yes, last year she had a derivation
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:30pm PST
you read the book right? bc that's what helped me score well during all of the tests
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:30pm PST
she didnt really specify what was on the test
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:30pm PST
and im like DDD=
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:30pm PST
bc someone asked her about it and she was like "i will say that there can be just so you dont completely disregard them"
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:29pm PST
wait did she have proofs nad deriving formulas on ur test?
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:29pm PST
hopefully not?
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:29pm PST
probably?
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:28pm PST

Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:28pm PST
oh shoot
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:28pm PST
and for los, you only need 2 sides and 1 angle and the angle doesn't need to be in the middle
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:28pm PST
like for loc, you make sure you have 2 side lengths and one angle in the middle
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:27pm PST
hopefully
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:27pm PST
ok, so you know the general ways to solve those kinds of problems?
Monday, December 7, 2015 at 10:27pm PST

Wednesday, December 2, 2015 at 11:12pm PST
"they dont nearly look as witchy as you do" is that a compliemnt? or insult?
Wednesday, December 2, 2015 at 11:12pm PST

Wednesday, December 2, 2015 at 11:11pm PST
haha omg rlly? well, first time for everything. complicated? well.. when you want exactly the right article of clothing at the price you want.. maybe not complicated .. idk. but some people like shoppng =) maybe thatll be you

Wednesday, December 2, 2015 at 10:23pm PST

Wednesday, December 2, 2015 at 9:22pm PST

Wednesday, December 2, 2015 at 9:22pm PST
yes. just add conclusion, explain the whole process of rock candy formation, say why your rock candy turned out the way it did (we can talk about how we added too much of everything which thereby created a lot of rock candy)
Wednesday, December 2, 2015 at 9:21pm PST
apeng is purgatory :)
Wednesday, December 2, 2015 at 9:21pm PST
also, tbh you should have a cat bc you looked like a chemistry witch when you were mixing stuff in chem lol
Wednesday, December 2, 2015 at 9:20pm PST
idk i saw a lion video in my feed and wondered if you liked them. they remind me of cats, which are cute but dangerous
Wednesday, December 2, 2015 at 9:20pm PST

Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:50pm PST
acting polite is so hard bc i have a natural propensity toward rudeness
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:50pm PST
bc i feel lonely :( the only person i slightly know in my calc class is adrian. and this guy sits next to me and he's always boasting about how good he is at calc and physics and i have to act polite anyway
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:49pm PST
she explained them to us on the 2nd week of school or something
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:48pm PST
lol all of her college relationships

division of labor = win
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:48pm PST
omg. tbh we only did until the first body paragraph and a little of the second. we're going to fail. it's all right though bc i guess after a while there's nowhere to go but up (wow i'm so optimistic)
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:47pm PST
lol i dont think i have a favorite celestial object
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:46pm PST

Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:38pm PST
confession: late at night when i'm still up doing hw and my morale's going down, i go down and smell the mint, which immediately makes me feel happier :D
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:37pm PST
and there's crushed mint on it
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:37pm PST
so my mom got a crushed herbs spinning holder thingy
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:37pm PST

Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:36pm PST
which makes me regret being in calc lol
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:36pm PST
esp bc you guys discuss how the howell test was in chem
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:36pm PST
the only thing i remember from howell is the A, B, C, D chart of relationships so i'm curious as to how everyone perceives her this year
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:35pm PST
lol maybe she wanted me to slow down bc when i'm nervous i talk really quickly
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:35pm PST
mine was amanda. oh that's actually really smart! see, i don't think of these things. my pair wrote together so we didn't finish and we're probably going to get 2/9
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:34pm PST
same. except my mom doesn't wear makeup either haha. i'm pretty sure something's going to get smudged/look wrong for me, but whatever
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:33pm PST
that actually seems better than my idea. well, it's not really my idea bc i partially ripped off gialdini's example lol
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:32pm PST
yeah i'm such a stalker lol
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 10:32pm PST

Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 9:38pm PST
lol so today during the timed write, i was trying to explain what i was thinking to my partner bc i'm not eloquent when speaking
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 9:38pm PST

Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 9:37pm PST
i'm scared we'll have to wear makeup
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 9:37pm PST
excited for the gatsby party?
Tuesday, December 1, 2015 at 9:37pm PST

Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 10:27pm PST

Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 2:17pm PST
it's fun when you don't have any other work to do :/
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 2:17pm PST
yay me neither! i feel like there should be a club for procrastinators haha
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 2:16pm PST
lol i'd have to carry my refrigerator to school w/ me haha i guess you'll just have to live vicariously
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 2:15pm PST

Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 9:28am PST
omg i haven't logged into wattpad in so long
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 9:28am PST
GIVE ME YOUR STORY LINK I WANT TO READ IT
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 9:27am PST
oh ty for the science-y compliment LOL
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 9:27am PST
lol i'm actually debating doing something like that for my own story for fun (bc i like programming) so i can get my story consistent
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 9:25am PST
also, he has a website of java applets to simulate black holes and he has lots of science papers that explain the math behind his books (he's my role model haha)
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 9:24am PST
lol "science-y" but read greg egan! seriously. he makes me feel unintelligent all the time, which is kind of fun
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 9:23am PST
lol the shortness is good too bc i have 2 chaps for apush to take notes on :'(
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 9:22am PST
YAY I WANT TO READ IT :)))) i wonder what it's about if it's so different from your other stories
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:26am PST
Also each "chapter" is super short. The whole book/short story is around 10,000 words
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:26am PST
Fun fact: I let my friends read the first chapter after it was written and they thought that the names were too German so I wrote random ones
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:25am PST
;) it's very bad but it's different from my other books so I thought you'd like it more. Idk
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:24am PST
Do you want to read the first chapter of a book I did for #justwriteit on wattpad?
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:14am PST
:)
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:13am PST
Idk who that is but sounds very interesting
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:13am PST
LOLOL what good would writing real romance be ;) what you have is great
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:13am PST
Wow very interesting. I think this will be the first book I read that's more focused on math than people
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:10am PST
Sci fi*
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:10am PST
I might have not read any of the sci do suggestions you gave me... Haha
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:10am PST
LOL nah prob because I'm not too familiar with the genre
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:09am PST
Intriguing
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:09am PST

Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:09am PST
Science-y
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:09am PST
Sciences

Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:08am PST
Lol MAYBE next year :) we'll see
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 1:07am PST
Haha I know what you mean.
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:47am PST
:)
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:47am PST
they're more like vessels for the information that i choose to reveal at certain times (i got inspired by greg egan lol)
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:46am PST
i wish i had experience writing real romance. but inconsistencies is more about the geometry introduced rather than the characters and their personalities
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:45am PST
describe the 1st chapter in one word. i have the feeling you either don't like sci-fi or there's something wrong with the way i convey relationships lol
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:44am PST
aaaat :)
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:44am PST
aaaaaaa
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:44am PST

Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:43am PST
oh well. i still think nano's fun bc it gives me something to look forward to every day :D
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:43am PST
it's so difficult to convey an idea on paper when you've been dreaming about it for so long and expect others to know
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:42am PST
sorryyyyy
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:42am PST
No? Gah sorry I don't have answers to the questions you're asking me

Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:40am PST
Uh I can't say that I know who they are
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:39am PST
if it can even be called work
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:39am PST
i'm embarrassed bc that's my natural state of being when someone reads my work lol
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:39am PST
do you know who they are?
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:39am PST
Why are you mortified
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:39am PST
I'm curious as to what happens next. Their relationship, what world they're in, etc etc
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:39am PST
i am mortified :(
Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:38am PST

Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:18am PST

Saturday, November 21, 2015 at 12:14am PST

OMG YOU GOT 96 on GATE and 2 600's OMG you are so smart why do you ever say you're not?! that's not far off from what i (and the actually smart people) got
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 11:32pm PST
i'm a direct person and people have called me mean before. if you were stupid, i would tell you. meanly. while laughing evilly
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 11:32pm PST

Friday, November 20, 2015 at 11:30pm PST
wait what comments? you know what, the next time i talk to you, it'll be when you're online and don't see a wall of text when you log on
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 11:29pm PST

Friday, November 20, 2015 at 11:28pm PST
omg i haven't stalked you bc i actually respect your privacy but i'm not friends with him so i wanted to find out if he was worth sending a friend request to
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 11:26pm PST
you will take BC i swear i'll go griffith on howell if she doesn't let you. YOU WILL LOVE CALC (even evren, who got a b in howell, regrets taking ab bc it's too easy)
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 11:25pm PST
oh yeah, i think you told me about your silly mistakes before but i forgot bc selective memory :( i make them in calc too so i can relate.
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 11:23pm PST
haha all hail the rainbow unicorn
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 11:23pm PST

Friday, November 20, 2015 at 11:22pm PST
lol yay i was able to help (negligibly, but hey i still did) :) gialdini's not very nice that way :/ ik most other teachers would cut us juniors some slack but no ofc she wouldn't
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 11:21pm PST

Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:55pm PST
haha no im actually not better at synthesizing chem concepts. you are. i mostly just read whats off the paper
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:54pm PST
LOl at least you made it. who cares if it was 99th or 98
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:53pm PST
gah dont even GATE test me. i got like 96th percentile. not even close enough to make it in. although i did get in for math? (is it possible to be in gate only 1 subject?) because i think i got like 2 consecutive years of 600 in math. or maybe im just hyping myself up and it was only 1. anyways yeah i was def not smart enough to make it into GATe
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:52pm PST
lolol thats what the comments said. but if it makes u feel better, go for it
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:52pm PST
lol thanks. i am a generally humorous person. i love it when people laugh at my stupidity and intentional joking ways to hide the fact that i am cold and dark and crazy
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:51pm PST
i am always very careful with mvs. u never know what youll see
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:51pm PST
haha i havent actually watched music video

lol yes i have all sorts of problems
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:50pm PST
haha im fine with taking ab. not like i would be able to take bc anyways
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:49pm PST
suckss*
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:49pm PST
lol when i look at the test its just mostly stupid errors, or things i just didnt realize at the time. stuckss
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:49pm PST
haha wow. this rainbow unicorn thing.. is great
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:48pm PST
omg there's no way she'd let me repick. after thursday all people are "set in stone" and shed just blame me for being the one to not make sure there was a good biography on him before isgned up
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:47pm PST
haha maybe i am peaceful.. and boring. OMG THAT REFERENCE aiya
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:46pm PST
thanks
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:46pm PST
LOL okay ill reconsider it. =) actually as of right now it may be the best choice
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:42pm PST
^always end conversations w/ a pusheen haha in this case, this is me :D
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:41pm PST
 
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:29pm PST
idk how to make anyone feel better... haha you have to rescind your previous assertion
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:29pm PST
omg did i just go philosophical on you?
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:29pm PST
sometimes, it's the obvious people who are full of hot air
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:28pm PST
but i feel like a lot of people underestimate your abilities while you're actually probs the smartest person underneath :)
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:28pm PST
no i'm not a stalker
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:28pm PST
i'd like to think that the gate was stupid bc you're better at synthesizing chem concepts (i've watched you in class)
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:27pm PST
and 98th apparently indicates that you have a lower IQ than the 99ths
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:27pm PST
almost everyone in my school got 99th (who got into GATE). and when i did too, people predictably asked me my score
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:26pm PST
i remember the GATE test. i got 98th percentile
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:26pm PST
that article was probs written by a night owl to validate himself in life
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:26pm PST
omg
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:25pm PST
lol what. "rant in quality"? you make me laugh even when i feel horrible :)
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:25pm PST
lol the women gyrating on the screen severely disturbed me. loss of innocence anyone?
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:24pm PST
i feel like the selection was very strange. i may have slightly stalked the other lab person (matthew wang) and i'll have you know i'm not significantly impressed by his constant swearing on fb
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:23pm PST
not that you can't do it w/o my help :) you have it inside you to do well in math. just like me in apeng. it's mostly confidence/procrastination rather than genuine mathematical aptitude
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:22pm PST
and unfortunately, unless you get a solid A, you have to take ab. :(
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:22pm PST
you know, if you ever have problems with precal, you can ask me. :) believe it or not, i actually WANT you to take ap calc bc next year
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:19pm PST
wow i made you feel better?! see that glow emanating from me? it's the glow of a BENGALI RAINBOW UNICORN ANGEL.
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:18pm PST
oh :( well i guess you know more about these books bc it's your person, but i think worst comes to worst, you can tell gialdini about the lack of reputable biographies and she'll let you repick? if you can't find any in the next few days, you should probs email her (she gets mad when you don't ask questions e.g. my parent-teacher conf)
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:16pm PST
lol what do you even have to rant about? you seem pretty peaceful (unlike me, i'm very violent just like griffith during paret's fight lol) so i always thought you'd have a relatively peaceful life (ik don't judge people by their covers) but i'm pretty loud so
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:14pm PST
pleaseee i actually liked this book :)
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:14pm PST
i looked specifically for a book that wasn't a kids book :) from the children's library
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 10:13pm PST
jessica btw i checked its stats (there's an info page for the book and it has 273 pages) also it has a rating of 4.1/5. it's at fremont main and dublin (i think) GO CHECK IT OUT
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 7:38pm PST

Friday, November 20, 2015 at 7:25pm PST
OMG there's NO WAY I'm getting a 100%. I don't even have a 90%
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 7:24pm PST
LOLOL thanks. I have great confidence. Sometimes. No usually. So I guess when I do it does make a big difference haha. I'm flattered
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 7:23pm PST
:)))
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 7:23pm PST
Thank you so much lily! You make me feel so much better
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 7:23pm PST
Haha I've looked through a lot of books, and the best ones I've found are either the unauthorized one or an interviews one which can't be used. Maybe I just need to reconsider some again...
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 7:21pm PST
LOL haha aw thank you :) maybe I should rant to you more often
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 7:21pm PST
Yeah I am. And aw thanks for helping me <3 I did consider it but it either had 20 pages too few or had bad reviews. I don't remember which.
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 4:12pm PST
lol it's not even half as long as my rants
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 4:11pm PST
and yw for listening to your 'rant'
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 4:11pm PST

Friday, November 20, 2015 at 4:11pm PST
you're amazing :D
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 4:10pm PST
tbh you're so much better at chem labs than i am so it's kinda good luck that i got the position but TY :))) i'm excited for it
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 4:10pm PST
you will get 100% in howell. i shall crown you the queen of precalc
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 4:09pm PST
omg today you were so confident in the lab and i thought you knew how to cook :O wow you really are good at "fake it till you make it" lol
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 4:08pm PST
we won't stop until we find one that works
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 4:08pm PST
if my suggestion doesn't work, i'll help you look for another biography
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 4:07pm PST
and also, i feel happy that you're ranting to me (ikr i'm so mean bc that's essentially wishing ill on others) but only bc i always rant and now i get to return the favor of listening :)
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 4:06pm PST
and did you think about using the book Futurist : The Life and Films of James Cameron
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 4:06pm PST
In that case, I just searched up on the alameda county catalog
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 4:06pm PST
You're still doing James Cameron right?
Friday, November 20, 2015 at 3:56pm PST
Anyways thanks for letting me vent

Thursday, November 19, 2015 at 8:19pm PST
hchem was easy compared to this
Thursday, November 19, 2015 at 8:18pm PST

Thursday, November 19, 2015 at 8:18pm PST
i might have been sarcastic during it but it was much better than book work

satisfied?
Thursday, November 19, 2015 at 12:31am PST
temp difference => phase change
Thursday, November 19, 2015 at 12:31am PST
for the water droplets, it's bc water vapor in the air suddenly condenses against the colder surface of the beaker
Thursday, November 19, 2015 at 12:30am PST
i'll let you figure out why by yourself
Thursday, November 19, 2015 at 12:30am PST
for methane it's bc all gases behave ideally when at low pressures and high temps
Thursday, November 19, 2015 at 12:30am PST
LOL
Thursday, November 19, 2015 at 12:30am PST
ok then

you're less of a procrastinator than i am
Thursday, November 19, 2015 at 12:29am PST
also why does methane gas not behave as ideal gas at low temp and high pressure
Thursday, November 19, 2015 at 12:29am PST

^i hvae no idea what my pseudointellectual words i put in there
Friday, November 13, 2015 at 10:15pm PST
no not implying that youre not passionate, just saying that your diction of "passionate" implies a very strong feeling which, since you mostly seem excited all the time, i suppose i may bhave misjudged and agree that yes you are usually passionare about things
Friday, November 13, 2015 at 10:12pm PST
they're due monday :( such a waste of time
Friday, November 13, 2015 at 10:12pm PST

Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:48pm PST
Yeah probably. Not too much happened
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:47pm PST
Haha yeah i was expecting a backside
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:47pm PST
Yeah I guess. Although in general I didn't know anything
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:47pm PST
Lol well I was unlucky :(
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:47pm PST

Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:46pm PST
parent teacher conferences coming up :( my parents actually want to go to gialdini
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:46pm PST
i think she ran out of stuff to ask. did you notice how short the test was?
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:46pm PST
i feel like the only relevant questions were the analysis ones. i mean, how is setting even important?
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:45pm PST
luck
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:45pm PST
omg i guessed tom buchanan ahah
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:45pm PST

i think i got ny and east egg at least partially wrong
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:45pm PST
Ikr me too! These were too specific and asked for too much detail I didn't have
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:44pm PST
Tom Buchanan apparently
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:44pm PST
Gah maybe I should've read shmoop too
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:44pm PST
for some reason, i thought the icb test was easier
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:43pm PST
wait who was the 21 question?
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:43pm PST
i don't want to think about the test rn
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:43pm PST
ugh yes new york
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:43pm PST
lol i only remembered the eye bc i read shmoop and basically regurgitated its analysis
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:42pm PST
I think I put a lot of wrong assumptions on there
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:42pm PST
Lol "EAST EGG IS... EAST?"
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:42pm PST
And I put the wrong person who 21 something
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:41pm PST
Also I didn't know New York
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:41pm PST
Same! Also I completely forgot what the eye of the doctor thing was
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:41pm PST
Haha you are actually a surprise
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:40pm PST
how detailed do you need to be about east egg anyway
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:40pm PST
the settings thingy is going to make my grade go whoosh in the downward direction
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:40pm PST
SAME
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:39pm PST

Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:38pm PST
And haha I was planning on intercepting you before you left
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:38pm PST
Lol you don't need to apologize
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:38pm PST
I was planning on making a quiet exit before you showed up.
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:38pm PST
this is awkward
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:38pm PST
but hi
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:37pm PST
This is my fault :(
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:37pm PST
Also, i'm really really sorry. I guess my voice just has a patronizing tone even when I don't mean it to :/ You're actually one of the super smart people and you're not mediocre or whatever you were saying in chem (i don't really remember/selective memory) and I don't think you are either.
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:36pm PST
wow that's actually a big compliment :)
Thursday, November 12, 2015 at 3:35pm PST

Sunday, November 8, 2015 at 4:04pm PST

Sunday, November 8, 2015 at 4:03pm PST

Sunday, November 8, 2015 at 3:21pm PST
Noo I'm sure you bubbled in everything correctly
Sunday, November 8, 2015 at 3:21pm PST
Lol if the curve is higher that means your test is harder? :)
Sunday, November 8, 2015 at 3:12am PST

Saturday, November 7, 2015 at 10:49pm PST
I haven't done any homework today OMG
Saturday, November 7, 2015 at 10:49pm PST
Lol okay I'll listen to it on a bit (if I remember)

Saturday, November 7, 2015 at 10:23pm PST

Saturday, November 7, 2015 at 8:08pm PST
no i had wheaton
Saturday, November 7, 2015 at 8:08pm PST
lolol i bet it mostly takes that long becase the time it takes to ship the tests there and then have to get mostly everyone's done scanning before scores released
Saturday, November 7, 2015 at 8:07pm PST
lol language listening tests only come once a year. hopefully i didnt blow my shot
Saturday, November 7, 2015 at 8:07pm PST

Saturday, November 7, 2015 at 8:07pm PST
also language schools just = more work. idk if youd want that haha
Saturday, November 7, 2015 at 8:06pm PST
haha even if there was is there a subject test for it?
Saturday, November 7, 2015 at 8:06pm PST
haha i wont. ://// just becuase its my native language doesnt mean that I will get perfect. besides there were some words i didnt know how to read and i screwed up the last five questions :/
Saturday, November 7, 2015 at 8:05pm PST

Saturday, November 7, 2015 at 10:03am PST

:/ that was supposed to encourage you to get 100%
Friday, November 6, 2015 at 12:28am PST
imagine the planes in 3-d (e.g. torus-shaped perceptions). the 4-d conception of the universe is what i'm getting at, and the 5-d naming of the perceptions based on human occupancy
Friday, November 6, 2015 at 12:28am PST
LOL dw i dont want to hold yours either

In this way, Douglass’ dual, related tones serve to illustrate his eventual disillusionment with the vision of perfection that he once considered to be freedom.
Wednesday, November 4, 2015 at 6:58pm PST
wait, jessica, for the 1/2 essay, would this kind of a third sentence be ok? I'm asking you bc you generally know more about this writingy stuff
Wednesday, November 4, 2015 at 6:57pm PST

Wednesday, November 4, 2015 at 6:57pm PST

Sunday, October 25, 2015 at 2:07pm PDT
ions are generally considered neither polar nor nonpolar btw bc they have an overall charge, making polarity kind of useless in context
Sunday, October 25, 2015 at 2:05pm PDT
lol it was not flawless. i was insane when i wrote it. the title makes no sense and neither does the essay but it looks like i fooled my group :))
Saturday, October 24, 2015 at 10:32pm PDT
Also Monday before class I want to compare my answers with yours lol
Saturday, October 24, 2015 at 10:31pm PDT
I'm confused by the answers I'm googling

Is no3 2-, no3-, and ocn- polar or no polar?
Saturday, October 24, 2015 at 10:30pm PDT

Thursday, October 22, 2015 at 3:54pm PDT
so it was kind of funny today bc evren and kathryn were debating about the virtues of rallies in math class
Thursday, October 22, 2015 at 3:54pm PDT
but the fb wars get more ridiculous
Thursday, October 22, 2015 at 3:53pm PDT

Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:54pm PDT

Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:53pm PDT

Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:53pm PDT
and then hope for the best
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:53pm PDT
um tbh since i dont know for sure that its going to be on icb, im going to sparknote it
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:52pm PDT
haha ikr the specific instructions for the socratic seminar are so vague
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:52pm PDT
(i shall cheat off you somehow :) )
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:52pm PDT
what are you going to do to prepare?
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:52pm PDT
technically, it could be about heart of darkness for all we know
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:51pm PDT
she didn't even specify that it was on rhetorical strategies in icb lolll
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:51pm PDT
im not excited at all =(
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:51pm PDT

Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:49pm PDT
jessicaaa
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:49pm PDT
welcome :)
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:49pm PDT
thank you!!
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:49pm PDT
hm it makes more sense now, althought still confusing
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:49pm PDT
oh i see
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:49pm PDT
that was my simplest reference
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:48pm PDT
wait, you're talking about heat of formation of the compound (-675). yes, basically, you add 675
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:47pm PDT
a rod? oh my
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:47pm PDT
but the other negative value, when u add it you actually subtract it right?
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:47pm PDT
it's kinda like subtracting distances on a rod
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:47pm PDT
yes, sorry if that wasn't clear
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:47pm PDT
wait so when u subtract electron affinity ure actually adding it right?
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:46pm PDT
what other thing
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:46pm PDT
what about the other thing
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:46pm PDT
wait thats it
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:45pm PDT
states are super important
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:45pm PDT
and actually write out the individual reactions and then cancel until you get CaBr2(s) ==> Ca2+(g) + 2Br-(g)
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:45pm PDT
or you can use hess's law
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:45pm PDT
and subtract electron affinity
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:44pm PDT
add heat of formation, ionization energy etc
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:44pm PDT
so you use the chart
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:44pm PDT
you know the born-haber cycle? the chart's on the side
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:44pm PDT
there's no explanation for this on the website so i'll just tell you
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:43pm PDT
thank you!!! =)
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:43pm PDT
or i'll look at the solutions lol after i type it in
Tuesday, October 20, 2015 at 9:43pm PDT

Friday, October 16, 2015 at 12:29am PDT
i mean, when you start holding a ruler up to a computer to measure margins, i have to start questioning your sanity gialdini
Friday, October 16, 2015 at 12:29am PDT
but the precautions she takes are so overboard!
Friday, October 16, 2015 at 12:28am PDT
or i would tell you if she found out
Friday, October 16, 2015 at 12:28am PDT
it's ok :( i've had a discrepancy before. unfortunately, haven't gotten back the assignment yet
Friday, October 16, 2015 at 12:27am PDT

why is there a time limit on this stuff it's ridiculous
Friday, October 16, 2015 at 12:26am PDT
hmm. she might not notice on turnitin. but the discrepancy stuff...
Friday, October 16, 2015 at 12:25am PDT

Friday, October 16, 2015 at 12:25am PDT
bc its not actually slanted?

i think it was subject,speaker,audience
Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:12pm PDT

Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:11pm PDT
Lol if u read through to the end you'd know what I think about that book
Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:11pm PDT

Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:08pm PDT
:)))
Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:08pm PDT
oh yeah, i'll tell you about my novel idea too... later
Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:08pm PDT

Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:03pm PDT
i have such a weird life
Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:03pm PDT

Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:02pm PDT
What does that mean lol
Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:02pm PDT
OMG D: that's scary
Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:02pm PDT
also, apparently i said i didn't have to wake up at 7 bc the graph didn't have a root there
Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:01pm PDT
calculus is driving me insane :((
Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:01pm PDT
and she said that apparently i woke up in the morning screaming about roots and graphs and the mean value theorem
Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:01pm PDT
soooo it was kinda funny bc my mom was staring at me weirdly when i came back and i asked her why
Monday, October 5, 2015 at 4:00pm PDT

Sunday, October 4, 2015 at 9:11pm PDT

Sunday, October 4, 2015 at 5:39pm PDT

^lol idk random
Monday, July 20, 2015 at 6:30pm PDT
Haha and previously known things bore Lithium because Lithium Batterycharger, the intellectual superhero, fails to see the importance of repeating things she already knows. Once she knows it, she knows it forever. Thus, meetings are futile.
Monday, July 20, 2015 at 12:01pm PDT
But I'm sure someone told you the same thing already
Monday, July 20, 2015 at 12:00pm PDT
Aha you didn't have to reply :)

:)
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 10:16pm PDT
Wow. Just wow. I am. Blown away. By your acceptance. And while I will definitely save this somewhere I can look at it whenever my insecurities come to the forefront, I can't log off without saying this. Thank you. You are probably the most amazing friend I have ever had.
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 10:11pm PDT
we all have our insecurities
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 10:10pm PDT
and sorry, wasn't judging you
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 10:10pm PDT
but yeah, I agree with your RA
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 10:10pm PDT
^sorry that was super cheesy
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 10:10pm PDT
everything that you work hard for just makes it more rewarding when you achieve your goal. my dad always tells me that there's nothing easy in life. and the fact that you work so hard for everything you want means that you're miles ahead of everyone else - the people who don't know what they want or never take initiative. people who don't work because they expect things to be handed to them. and for your hard work, I admire you. One of our SAT practice prompts was which is more important: natural talent or hard work. Hard work automatically won, for me at least. It doesn't matter that some things might be harder for you to do. what matters is that in the end, you're way ahead of everyone else. Maybe smart isn't the right word to describe you. I should be calling you someone who is extremely passionate, dedicated, driven. Someone who can be a role model because they try their best and work tirelessly for their goal. You're incredible, and don't ever think otherwise.
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 10:03pm PDT
Ok bye. I'll come back when you've finished judging me
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 10:01pm PDT
Did I disillusion you?
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 10:01pm PDT
So changing the subjrct
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 10:00pm PDT
But anyway that was uncomfortably deep
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 10:00pm PDT
So she said that on the surface people who seem to have good things actually have nothing
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 9:59pm PDT
My RA told me something deep
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 9:59pm PDT
Not even making friends
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 9:58pm PDT
Nothing has ever come easy to me
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 9:58pm PDT
Serious
Sunday, July 12, 2015 at 9:58pm PDT
